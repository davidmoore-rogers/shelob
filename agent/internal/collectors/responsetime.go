// Package collectors holds the per-stream sample producers. Phase 3 ships
// the response-time collector end-to-end; telemetry / interfaces / storage
// land in Phase 5 (each has platform-specific code paths — PDH counters on
// Windows, /proc on Linux, sysctl/IOKit on macOS — and that's where the
// agent's footprint grows).
//
// The response-time stream measures the round-trip from the agent to the
// Polaris server (NOT a process-local liveness signal — that flat-zero
// shape was confusing operators since it told them nothing about whether
// the host could actually reach Polaris). The caller passes a probe
// function that performs one HTTP call to Polaris (a /heartbeat ping is
// what the agent uses); we time the call wall-clock and shape the result
// into a server-side sample row. When the probe errors, success=false +
// responseTimeMs=null = the standard "packet loss" signal in the existing
// chart, and the server's five-state machine flips warning/down via the
// same path the periodic puller uses.

// cheap server-side (single DB update), runs through the same pinned
// TLS transport the rest of the agent uses, so a TLS / cert / firewall
// failure surfaces the same way real traffic would. Returns success
// with the elapsed ms on a successful probe; success=false with the
// error message and a nil responseTimeMs on failure (packet-loss
// shape that the System tab chart already renders as a dropped sample).
