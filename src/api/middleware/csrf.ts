/**
 * src/api/middleware/csrf.ts — Synchronizer-token CSRF protection
 *
 * Pattern: a random token is generated per session and stored in the session
 * store (HttpOnly). The same value is exposed in a readable cookie so
 * same-origin JavaScript in our own pages can echo it in an `X-CSRF-Token`
 * header on state-changing requests. A cross-origin attacker can forge a
 * POST to Polaris but has no way to read the token cookie (Same-Origin
 * Policy) and therefore can't put a valid value in the header.
 *
 * This is defense-in-depth on top of `SameSite=Lax` + strict JSON content
 * types, not a replacement for them.
