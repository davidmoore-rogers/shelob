/**
 * src/jobs/autoBuildAgents.ts — Auto-build agent binaries when the
 * agent's version (NOT Polaris's version) drifts past what's on disk.
 *
 * Fires 60 s after boot, then once on every wake-up if a build is missed
 * — currently a one-shot since builds are infrequent and version bumps
 * land via in-app updates that restart the process anyway.
 *
 * Trigger logic (load-bearing comment; reflects the §12 plan and the
 * touches.md rebuild contract):
 *
 *   1. Skip if `<STATE_DIR>/data/agents/manifest.json` is missing.
 *      Fresh installs shouldn't fire a ~60 s CPU-pegging build for a
 *      feature the operator hasn't opted into. They click Build the
 *      first time when they actually want agents.
 *
 *   2. Skip if `manifest.currentVersion === getAgentVersion()`. Polaris
 *      patch releases that don't touch `agent/` produce no manifest drift
 *      and no auto-build noise — this is the load-bearing decoupling.
 *
 *   3. Skip + log warning if Go isn't installed. Emit
 *      agent.build.auto_skipped so operators can see the reminder on
 *      the Events page.
 *
 *   4. Skip silently if Setting `agent.autoBuildOnVersionMismatch` is
 *      false. Escape hatch for shops with strict supply-chain controls
 *      who want every binary build to be human-initiated.
 *
 *   5. Otherwise: kick off via the same path as the UI Build button.
 *      Actor stamped as "system:auto-build-on-version-change" so the
 *      audit trail distinguishes this from operator clicks.
