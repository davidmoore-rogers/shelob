/**
 * src/jobs/dependencyReconciler.ts
 *
 * 60-second reconciler — source of truth for `Asset.dependencySuppressed`.
 *
 * Loads every monitored asset, evaluates desired suppression state under
 * the all-down multi-parent semantics, writes only diffs, emits
 * `monitor.dependency_suppressed` / `monitor.dependency_resumed` Events
 * for transitions. The event-driven hook
 * `propagateAfterStatusChange` (called from recordProbeResult) is a
 * latency optimization on top of this — the periodic tick catches anything
 * the hook missed (server restart mid-transition, race with concurrent
 * probes, etc.).
 *
 * Independent `running` guard so a slow tick can't double-fire if the
 * fleet ever grows large enough that one pass exceeds 60s. Best-effort —
 * failures are logged at debug and never thrown.
 *
 * Import this module from src/app.ts to activate it.
