/**
 * src/jobs/retryQueuedReservationPushes.ts
 *
 * 60-second reconciler — retries DHCP reservation pushes that landed in the
 * "pending" state because the FortiGate (or FortiManager) was unreachable at
 * create time. The event-driven hook `triggerRetryAfterStatusChange`, fired
 * from monitoringService when a firewall asset transitions to up, is a
 * latency optimization on top of this — the periodic tick catches anything
 * the hook missed (server restart while queued, unmonitored gates, race with
 * concurrent discovery).
 *
 * Independent `running` guard so a slow tick can't double-fire if the queue
 * ever grows large enough that one pass exceeds 60s. Best-effort — failures
 * are logged at debug and never thrown.
 *
 * Import this module from src/app.ts to activate it.
