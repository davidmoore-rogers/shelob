/**
 * src/jobs/capacityWatch.ts
 *
 * Scheduled job: builds a capacity snapshot every 10 minutes and fires a
 * `capacity.severity_changed` Event whenever severity transitions
 * (ok ↔ watch ↔ amber ↔ red, in either direction).
 *
 * The route handler in `serverSettings.ts` also records transitions on
 * every `/pg-tuning` fetch, but that's only when an admin is actively
 * viewing the Maintenance tab. This job carries the transition signal
 * on a fixed cadence so the alert flows out through the syslog/SFTP
 * archival pipeline even when nobody is logged in — i.e. the case
 * where the DB is on the verge of dying and the UI is moments from
 * becoming unreachable.
 *
 * Best-effort. The `pgTuningNeeded` / `recommendedRamGb` inputs to the
 * snapshot are passed in as false here rather than re-running the full
 * pg-settings query — the job's value is in catching disk + autovacuum
 * transitions out-of-band, not in re-running the tuning advice on a timer.
 * The route handler runs the full computation when an admin loads the
 * Maintenance tab, so the snapshot stays accurate on the surface that
 * actually displays the reasons.
 *
 * Import this module from src/app.ts to activate it.
