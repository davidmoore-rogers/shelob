/**
 * src/jobs/renameMonitorClassKeys.ts
 *
 * One-shot startup migration that renames the per-class JSON keys in the
 * legacy monitorSettings Setting row from `fortiswitch` / `fortiap` to
 * generic `switch` / `accessPoint`. Phase 0 of the tiered sample-retention
 * work — see the plan for full context.
 *
 * In practice the nested per-class blocks only ever lived inside the legacy
 * `monitorSettings` Setting row (manualMonitorSettings and
 * Integration.config.monitorSettings carry flat tier-3 shapes; per-class
 * overrides live in MonitorClassOverride rows keyed by assetType). The
 * later `migrateMonitorSettingsHierarchy` job deletes the legacy row
 * outright once it has consumed it, so by the time this rename runs on
 * any modern install there is usually nothing to rename. This job exists
 * as a defensive safety net covering fixture data, test setups, partially
 * migrated installs, and the unlikely case of an operator hand-recreating
 * the legacy row.
 *
 * Strategy: copy values forward (don't delete the old keys yet). The
 * backwards-compat reader in `getMonitorSettings()` still falls back to
 * `v.fortiswitch` / `v.fortiap` if the new keys are missing, so a copy is
 * sufficient for the rename to take effect. A follow-up release that
 * deletes the legacy keys can land once we've confirmed the rename worked
 * fleet-wide.
 *
 * Idempotent via the `monitorClassKeysRenamedAt` Setting marker.

 * The old keys are deliberately preserved — the reader still falls back to

 * default. They'll be dropped in a follow-up release.
