/**
 * src/jobs/reconcileMapRegions.ts
 *
 * Periodic safety net for the map-region tag reconciler.
 *
 * The CRUD endpoints reconcile inline on every region edit, and end-of-FMG/
 * FortiGate discovery calls the reconciler too — this 6-hour tick is the
 * out-of-band catch for anything those paths missed (server restart mid-edit,
 * a firewall whose coords were updated outside discovery, etc.). Add-only:
 * never strips a tag — renames and deletes are handled by the dedicated
 * service paths so by the time this runs there's nothing stale to clean up.
 *
 * Independent `running` guard. Failures are logged at debug and never thrown.
 *
 * Import this module from src/app.ts to activate it.
