/**
 * src/jobs/backfillDependencyTree.ts
 *
 * One-shot startup job: rebuilds the dependency DAG once on boot so
 * existing installs don't have to wait for the next scheduled discovery
 * cycle (default 4 hours) before the dependency-suppression feature has
 * data to work with.
 *
 * Idempotent — `recomputeDependencyTree()` deletes the source="computed"
 * rows for in-scope assets and re-inserts from the current discovery
 * signals every run. Operator overrides (source="override") are never
 * touched.
 *
 * Failures are logged but never fatal — the next discovery cycle will
 * rebuild from real source-side writes regardless.
 *
 * Import this from src/app.ts to activate.
