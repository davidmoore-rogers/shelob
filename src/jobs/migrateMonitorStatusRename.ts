/**
 * src/jobs/migrateMonitorStatusRename.ts
 *
 * One-shot startup migration: renames the recovery state on
 * `Asset.monitorStatus` from the legacy value "pending" to "recovering".
 *
 * Background: the five-state monitor machine had two transitional states
 * ("warning" for was-up-now-failing and "pending" for was-down-now-
 * succeeding). Operators read "Pending" as "we don't know yet" rather
 * than the directional "recovering from down", so the user-facing label
 * was renamed. Internal state value followed for consistency.
 *
 * After this job runs, no Asset rows carry the legacy "pending" value.
 * The state machine in monitoringService writes "recovering" exclusively;
 * the never-probed status remains "unknown" / null and is rendered as
 * "Pending" in the UI for clarity.
 *
 * Idempotency: marker key "monitorStatusRenamePendingMigratedAt" in the
 * Setting table. Subsequent boots no-op.
 *
 * Recovery: delete the marker (`DELETE FROM "settings" WHERE key =
 * 'monitorStatusRenamePendingMigratedAt'`) and restart.
