/**
 * src/jobs/flagStaleReservations.ts
 *
 * Scheduled job: scans active dhcp_reservation rows for ones whose target
 * client hasn't been seen actively holding the IP within the configured
 * threshold and emits one `reservation.stale` Event per fresh transition.
 * `staleNotifiedAt` is stamped on the row so the alert doesn't refire on
 * subsequent runs; the discovery sync clears `staleNotifiedAt` when it sees
 * the IP active again, so re-arming is automatic.
 *
 * Runs every 6 hours (and once on startup) so the operator's threshold
 * adjustment takes effect within a quarter-day even on infrequently
 * restarted systems. Set `reservation.staleAfterDays` to 0 to disable.
 *
 * Import this module from src/index.ts to activate it.
