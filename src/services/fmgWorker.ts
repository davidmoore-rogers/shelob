/**
 * src/services/fmgWorker.ts — Per-integration FortiManager worker with two lanes.
 *
 * FortiManager's "one-request-at-a-time" rule is specifically about its
 * `/sys/proxy/json` passthrough endpoint, which forwards calls through to
 * managed FortiGates. FMG drops parallel proxy connections past 1-2 concurrent
 * requests for the same API user. Native FMG endpoints (`/pm/config/...`,
 * `/dvmdb/...`) hit FMG's own database and don't have that constraint.
 *
 * This worker therefore exposes two lanes per integration:
 *
 *   • Proxy lane  — strict single-consumer FIFO (concurrency = 1). Honors the
 *                   FMG hard limit. Used for every `/sys/proxy/json` call.
 *   • Native lane — unbounded; just tracks inflight count for observability.
 *                   Used for every CMDB / dvmdb / auth / other native call.
 *
 * Each lane has its own gauges: `polaris_fmg_worker_queue_depth` and
 * `polaris_fmg_worker_inflight` apply to the proxy lane (back-compat with the
 * pre-split metric names); `polaris_fmg_worker_native_inflight` is the native
 * lane's counter.
 *
 * Cross-feature serialization still holds where it matters: discovery's per-
 * device proxy queries, reservation push (proxy mode), quarantine push (proxy
 * mode), and the manual /sys/proxy/json proxy endpoint all share the same
 * single proxy slot per integration. Native queries — mgmt-IP resolution,
 * CMDB scrapes, the device roster — now run concurrently up to whatever
 * `discoveryParallelism` and the host can handle.
 *
 * Abort: `submitProxy()` and `submitNative()` both accept an optional
 * AbortSignal. Proxy lane: pre-dispatch abort yanks the entry from the queue.
 * Native lane: abort fires the underlying task's own signal-aware fetch
 * (the worker doesn't queue native calls so there's nothing to yank).
