/**
 * src/services/dnsResolvedReservationService.ts
 *
 * Auto-creates "DNS Resolved" reservations from Asset.ipAddress so IPs picked
 * up outside the DHCP/VIP/interface_ip discovery pipeline (AD forward-lookup,
 * Entra/Intune, manually-typed) still surface in the Networks IP panel.
 *
 * Behavior rules (see plan: dns-resolved reservations):
 *   - Only primary `Asset.ipAddress`; secondary AssetAssociatedIp is v1 OOS.
 *   - Eligible asset statuses: active / maintenance / storage / quarantined.
 *     decommissioned / disabled get their existing dns_resolved row released.
 *   - IPv4 only (the IP-panel UI and cidr helpers are IPv4-shaped).
 *   - Defers silently to any non-released authoritative reservation already
 *     at the same (subnetId, ipAddress) — manual / dhcp_reservation /
 *     dhcp_lease / interface_ip / vip / fortiswitch / fortinap / fortimanager
 *     / fortigate all win without raising a Conflict.
 *   - Never pushes to a FortiGate. createdBy = "system:dns-resolved".
 *   - When the asset's IP changes, the old row releases and a new one is
 *     created at the new IP. Same on asset delete (handled by the Prisma
 *     extension's pre-delete hook).
