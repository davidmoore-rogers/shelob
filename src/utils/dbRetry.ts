/**
 * src/utils/dbRetry.ts
 *
 * Postgres-deadlock retry helper. Postgres reports SQLSTATE 40P01 when it
 * breaks a deadlock cycle by aborting one participant; the abort is
 * intrinsic to the protocol, not a bug in our code. Re-running the same
 * statement after the contender finishes almost always succeeds.
 *
 * Up to 3 retries with a small jittered backoff so simultaneous deadlock
 * losers don't all retry in lockstep. Surfaces the error untouched on the
 * 4th failure so callers can record it exactly as before.
 *
 * Originally lived inline in src/utils/macAddresses.ts (the bulk MAC
 * reconcile path); factored out here so the sample-write buffer can
 * reuse the same retry shape without duplicating the SQLSTATE-extraction
 * code that has to be defensive about Prisma adapter shapes.
