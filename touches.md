# Polaris — Touches Index

A lookup index for cross-cutting invariants and per-service relationships in the Polaris codebase. Answers the question **"if I change X, what else touches it?"** without reading every consumer.

This file complements [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) — CLAUDE.md is the narrative architecture doc; this is the relationship/dependency map.

## How to use

1. **Before changing a service or a shared invariant**, find its section here.
2. Walk the **Used by** / **Writers** / **Readers** lists to see what depends on the thing you're touching.
3. Run through the **When changing this** checklist before opening a PR.
4. **Keep this file current.** Per CLAUDE.md's commit-review rule, every commit re-reads `touches.md` for staleness — if your change moved writers/readers, broke an invariant, or invalidated a checklist item, fix it in the same commit.

## Format

**Per-service** sections:
- **What it owns** — one-sentence responsibility
- **Public API** — exported symbols
- **Cross-service deps** — other `src/services/*` files this one imports
- **Used by** — external callers (`file:line — purpose`)
- **Invariants** — rules every caller must respect
- **When changing this** — pre-merge checklist

**Cross-cutting** sections swap **Used by** for separate **Writers** / **Readers** lists since the concern spans many files.

## Sections

- [Cross-cutting concerns](#cross-cutting-concerns) (16)
- [Per-service touches](#per-service-touches) — alphabetical, 42 services in `src/services/`

# Cross-cutting concerns

## cross-cutting/five-state-monitor-machine

**What it is:** Asset.monitorStatus ∈ {up, warning, recovering, down, unknown} driven by consecutiveFailures/consecutiveSuccesses counters (see "Five-state monitor machine" in CLAUDE.md).

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts` — runProbeFor() updates Asset.monitorStatus/consecutiveFailures/consecutiveSuccesses after each probe result, stamps Asset.monitorStatusChangedAt whenever monitorStatus changes value (any-to-any, not just up↔down), emits monitor.status_changed Event on up↔down transitions, fires propagateAfterStatusChange() to push the edge into descendant dependencySuppressed state
- `src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts` — Light/heavy ticking loops invoke runMonitorPass() which dispatches probe collection
- `src/jobs/backfillMonitorStatusChangedAt.ts` — One-shot startup (60s after boot): seeds Asset.monitorStatusChangedAt for pre-existing warning/down/recovering assets from the latest monitor.status_changed Event when one is still within the 7-day retention window
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts:651` — recordProbeResult() on manual /probe-now endpoint
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts` — PUT /assets/:id validateMonitorConfig handler resets consecutiveFailures on manual disable
- `src/db.ts:212-222` — Prisma extension clampMonitoredForStatus() forces monitored=false and resets consecutiveFailures when status flips to decommissioned/disabled

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- `public/js/assets.js:223-229` — Status pill renderer colors by monitorStatus (green/amber/blue/red/grey)
- `public/js/assets.js:1152` — intermittency-bar client-side replay engine reads monitorStatus to color per-sample cells
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:runMonitorPass()` — Heavy-cadence suppression gate: telemetry/systemInfo only run when monitorStatus==="up" AND !dependencySuppressed; probe interval doubles when dependencySuppressed (parent down)
- `src/services/dependencyTreeService.ts` — reconcileDependencySuppression() reads monitorStatus to evaluate "all-down" suppression — only the confirmed-down edge propagates (warning/recovering do NOT)
- `src/api/routes/map.ts` — Device Map topology endpoint reads monitorStatus for FortiGate/switch/AP health coloring via monitorStatusToHealth()
- `src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts:110` — Queue eligibility check consults monitorStatus + dependencySuppressed
- `src/api/routes/dashboard.ts` — `/dashboard/summary` reads `monitored=true AND monitorStatus in (warning, down)` for the Monitor Alerts card and orders by `monitorStatusChangedAt asc nulls last` so the oldest outages surface first
- `public/js/dashboard.js` — Monitor Alerts card renders the duration since monitorStatusChangedAt; re-ticks the label every 30s without re-fetching

**Invariants:**
- State machine accepts only {up, warning, recovering, down, unknown}; no other string values permitted.
- Transition to "down" happens when consecutiveFailures ≥ failureThreshold; to "up" when consecutiveSuccesses ≥ failureThreshold (same threshold both directions).
- "recovering" is the transient mid-recovery state (was-down, now succeeding). Exits to "up" once the success threshold is crossed.
- "warning" is mid-degradation (was-up, now accumulating failures but below threshold). Exits to "down" when threshold crossed, back to "up" on success.
- monitor.status_changed Event fires ONLY on up↔down transitions, not on warning/recovering churn. propagateAfterStatusChange() fires from the same edge so dependency suppression follows the confirmed-down edge — never the flap.
- monitorStatusChangedAt is stamped on EVERY transition (any-to-any), independent of the Event audit trail. The Event log is the up/down-only audit record; the column is the source for the Dashboard's "how long has this been warning/down" duration. Backfill from the Event log is best-effort because events prune at 7 days; older outages render "—".
- Heavy cadences (telemetry/systemInfo/fastFiltered) are suppressed when monitorStatus ≠ "up" OR dependencySuppressed. The probe runs at 2× cadence when dependencySuppressed AND responseTimePolling !== "disabled".
- Response-time probe runs in every state; it's the cheap path that detects recovery.

**When changing this:**
- Verify every state assignment matches the rules above (no bypass paths).
- Check assets.js intermittency-bar replay logic replays the five-state machine forward correctly (must use same failureThreshold).
- Confirm monitor.status_changed Event audit trail only has up/down transitions (search logs for other values = bug).
- Test manual /probe-now against a down asset — should advance consecutiveSuccesses and possibly transition to recovering within one call.
- Check Map topology endpoint colors match asset list Status pills (monitorStatusToHealth must be consistent).
- Verify clamp logic in db.ts doesn't interfere: disable should reset, but re-enable (flip to active) should not auto-resume monitoring.
- If touching the cadence dispatch (runMonitorPass / publishDueWork): mirror EVERY change in BOTH `src/services/monitoringService.ts` AND `src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts` — they're parallel implementations and must stay in lock-step.

## cross-cutting/asset-source-projection

**What it is:** Multi-source asset discovery unified via AssetSource rows and deriveAssetSources() / projectAssetFromSources() pure functions (see "Asset projection priority table" in CLAUDE.md).

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/db.ts:59-132` — Prisma extension shadowWriteAssetSources() upserts AssetSource rows on every asset.create/update/upsert when assetTag/tags/discoveredByIntegrationId change
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:1629-1760` — upsertFortigateFirewallAssetSource() / upsertFortinetInfraAssetSource() for FMG/FortiGate firewall/switch/AP discovery
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:3969-4020` — Entra/Intune upsert paths (buildEntraSource / buildIntuneFdmSource + upsertEntraIntuneSources)
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:3622-3650` — fortigate-endpoint AssetSource stamping on DHCP endpoint discovery
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — Active Directory / Windows Server discovery paths upsert ad / windowsserver source rows
- `src/jobs/backfillAssetSources.ts` — One-shot startup: derives sources from legacy assetTag / sid: / ad-guid: tag conventions
- `src/utils/assetSourceDerivation.ts` — deriveAssetSources() implements source derivation rules for both shadow-write and backfill

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- `src/utils/assetProjection.ts:279-321` — projectAssetFromSources() reads AssetSource rows and applies priority rules to build ProjectedAsset shape
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts` — Asset read endpoints attach AssetSource rows in the assetSources relation
- `src/services/projectionDriftService.ts` — Compares projectAssetFromSources() output against Asset field values to detect drift
- Discovery paths use projectAssetFromSources() output as the source of truth for Asset field writes (Phase 3b.1 cutover pending)

**Invariants:**
- Every AssetSource row must have sourceKind + externalId (unique key); created/updated by discovery or the shadow-write extension.
- inferred=true rows are backfill skeletons; projection ignores them (they predate real discovery).
- observed JSON blob is owned by the discovery pathway that explicitly writes it (Phase 2+); shadow-write never touches observed on update, only on initial create.
- Priority rules in projectAssetFromSources() are immutable for production stability; tuned from shadow-drift logs and locked with operators.
- Fortinet infrastructure (firewall/switch/AP) sources are derived from serial + manufacturer + assetType during backfill; discovery writes explicit "fortigate-firewall" / "fortiswitch" / "fortiap" source rows.
- fortigate-endpoint source is stamped on endpoint-type assets discovered via DHCP; marked as infra if assetType is "firewall"/"switch"/"access_point".
- `fortigate-firewall` observed blob owns the THREE coord tiers (`snmpGeocodedLatitude/Longitude`, `metavarLatitude/Longitude`, `latitude/longitude`) plus `snmpLocation`. Latitude/longitude projection rules walk the three tiers in that order on the SAME source kind, validating each (lat,lng) pair as a whole via `isValidGeoCoord` so a half-valid tier falls through instead of mixing values. `snmpLocation` is its own projected field (string).
- HA-cluster firewalls (a-p / a-a) get one `fortigate-firewall` source row PER physical member, keyed on each member's own stable serial. The observed blob carries member-specific `serial` / `hostname` / `mgmtIp` plus cluster-wide `haMode` / `haRole` / `haPeerSerial`. The standby member's `mgmtIp` is null (cluster IP only reaches the active member). Phase 3 fan-out keys each member's Asset lookup on its OWN serial — never on `device.sn` which flips on failover.

**When changing this:**
- Modify priority rules only if tuned against real drift logs and agreed with operators (don't guess).
- If adding a new discovery source kind, pair it with an AssetSource upsert in the discovery path AND update deriveAssetSources() rules for backfill coverage.
- Test shadow-write: create an asset with assetTag, verify AssetSource row exists; update assetTag, verify the row is refreshed.
- Run projectionDriftService on next discovery cycle and check pino logs for "asset.projection.drift" — should be silent on stable sources.
- Verify backfill catches the new source kind: run startup job, spot-check a few assets have the right AssetSource rows.

## cross-cutting/polling-method-resolver

**What it is:** Four-tier cascade resolving which polling method (REST API / SNMP / WinRM / SSH / ICMP / Disabled / Polaris Agent) is used for each asset's response-time / telemetry / system-info / fastFiltered probes (see "Monitor Settings Hierarchy" + "Polling-method compatibility matrix" in CLAUDE.md). The `"agent"` method short-circuits the periodic puller (probeAsset / collectTelemetry / collectSystemInfo / collectFastFiltered all early-return) because the Polaris Agent on the host pushes its own samples via `POST /api/v1/agents/samples`.

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts` — PUT /assets/:id sets per-asset override columns (responseTimePolling / cpuMemoryPolling / temperaturePolling / interfacesPolling / lldpPolling)
- `src/api/routes/monitorSettings.ts` — POST MonitorClassOverride upserts class-tier overrides for (integrationId, assetType)
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — Integration config JSON holds tier-3 Integration.config.monitorSettings
- `src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts` — PUT /server-settings updates tier-4 manualMonitorSettings Setting
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:resolveMonitorSettings / resolveMonitorSettingsWithProvenance` — Only readers; these are pure resolvers, not writers

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:runMonitorPass` — per-stream (probe/telemetry/systemInfo/fastFiltered) dispatch branches consult resolved settings to pick method + timeout + retry logic
- `src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts` — publishDueWork() and light/heavy loops call resolveMonitorSettings() to determine which assets are due for each cadence
- `public/js/assets.js` — Asset Monitoring tab UI renders manual override tier (per-asset dropdowns + per-stream SNMP credential pickers + per-stream MIB pickers); class override editor renders all three sub-rows (polling, credential, MIB) per stream
- `public/js/integrations.js` — Integration Monitoring tab renders the integration tier (Cadence & Retention + per-stream polling dropdowns + per-stream MIB pickers when stream = SNMP). Class overrides have moved to the Assets-page Monitoring Settings modal. Shared helpers: `_polarisPollingFourStreamHTML` (4-stream polling block with optional cred/MIB sub-rows), `_polarisReadPollingFourStream` / `_polarisReadCredFourStream` / `_polarisReadMibFourStream`, `_mibOptionsHTML`, `_populateUploadedMibsInDropdowns`
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts` — GET /assets/:id/effective-monitor-settings endpoint returns full resolved stack + provenance (used by System tab intermittency-bar replay, by per-stream chart badges to label which tier supplied each polling method — see _streamBadgeText in public/js/assets.js — AND by the stale-data banner threshold; the three callers in assets.js cache `eff.resolved` in `_effectiveResolvedByAssetId` so banner slots can re-evaluate against the class/integration cadence after first paint)
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts` — GET /assets/:id exposes `discoveredByIntegration.useProxy` (FMG only) so the System tab chart badges can render "Proxy via <fmg>" vs "Direct" without a second round-trip; integration `config` otherwise stripped to keep API tokens out of the response
- **Raw-SQL readers (NOT type-checked against Prisma schema)** — these hardcode the per-stream column names in `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe` strings; a schema column rename will compile clean but 500 at runtime:
  - `src/services/capacityService.ts` — `telemetryEligibleSQL` reads `"cpuMemoryPolling"`; `systemInfoEligibleSQL` reads `"interfacesPolling"`. Used to project steady-state DB size.
  - `src/services/capacityAdvisorService.ts:readApplicableCounts` — same two columns, used to compute per-cadence worker recommendations.

**Invariants:**
- Resolver applies the four-tier cascade strictly in order: per-asset → class-override → integration → manual, first non-null wins.
- Resolved method must be compatible with the asset's source kind (checked by isPollingMethodCompatible against COMPATIBILITY matrix in pollingCompatibility.ts).
- If a higher tier specifies an incompatible method, it silently falls through to the next tier (never error; don't break monitoring).
- Compatibility matrix is locked per CLAUDE.md "Polling-method compatibility matrix"; breaches must go through the design process.
- AD-discovered assets default to ICMP for response-time unless the operator picks winrm/ssh on the per-asset tier (bind-creds fallback at probe time).
- FMG/FortiGate-discovered firewalls default to REST API on response-time / telemetry / interfaces and `disabled` on LLDP (FortiOS REST `lldp-neighbors` is empty on most fleets — operators flip back to `rest_api` if their fleet has it enabled).
- `"agent"` is never a source default — only an opt-in via the operator. Compatible only with AD / Entra / Windows Server / Manual sources (NOT fortimanager / fortigate). When set, probeAsset returns `finish(start, true)` synthetic-success, recordProbeResult early-returns to skip the state machine, and the three collect* dispatchers return `{supported: false}` — the agent on the host is the sole writer for those streams.

**When changing this:**
- Compatibility matrix changes require design review and manual tier updates across the codebase (four UI surfaces).
- If adding a new polling method, update: pollingCompatibility.ts, monitoringService.ts dispatch branches, all four UI tiers (assets.js / integrations.js / serverSettings.js), and test tier resolution.
- Verify fallthrough logic: resolve a method that's incompatible for an asset's source and confirm it doesn't get used (add a test to monitoringService).
- Check every stream independently: one asset might have responseTimePolling=snmp, cpuMemoryPolling=rest_api, temperaturePolling=snmp, systemInfoPolling=icmp; all valid per source.
- Audit UI disable-logic matches the matrix (if a source doesn't support REST API, the dropdown should not offer it).
- **Renaming a per-stream column requires updating the raw-SQL readers listed above** — Prisma's typed queries get rewritten automatically by the generated client, but `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe` strings don't. Cross-reference `cross-cutting/schema-migrations-and-prisma-client-lifecycle` for the full rename checklist.

## cross-cutting/polaris-agent

**What it is:** Polaris-managed agent installed on remote hosts that pushes monitoring samples back to Polaris over HTTPS and holds a long-lived outbound WebSocket for on-demand probes. New `"agent"` polling-method value (7th) compatible only with AD / Entra / Windows Server / Manual sources. One `ManagedAgent` row per asset, FK cascade. See CLAUDE.md "Polaris Agent polling-method" / "Polaris Agent API surface" and the plan at `~/.claude/plans/the-app-needs-a-glowing-knuth.md`.

**Writers** (state that mutates ManagedAgent / agent.* events):
- `src/services/agentChannelService.ts` — in-memory `Map<managedAgentId, WebSocket>` session manager. `attach()` registers + schedules 30s heartbeat pings + bumps wsConnectedAt + emits `agent.connected`. `detach()` clears the timer, rejects any pending probe-now promises, closes the socket, bumps wsDisconnectedAt + emits `agent.disconnected`. `sendProbeNow(stream, timeoutMs)` is the server-→agent verb used by /probe-now in agent-mode; `refreshConfig()` sends a `refresh-config` frame so the agent re-fetches /config immediately. Idempotent: replacing an existing session for the same agentId closes the old socket.
- `src/api/routes/agentsWs.ts` — `attachAgentWsUpgradeHandler(server)` wires `http.Server.on("upgrade", ...)` to validate the bearer carried in `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: polaris-agent.v1.bearer.<token>`, then hands the socket to `agentChannelService.attach`. Mounted twice: once on the HTTP listener (src/app.ts), once on the HTTPS listener (src/httpsManager.ts after listen()). Bearer never echoed back on the upgrade response — the client `ws` library accepts a no-protocol response by default.
- `agent/cmd/polaris-agent/main.go` — host-side Go binary; loads agent.conf, runs /enroll on first boot (persists returned bearer back to agent.conf via Save), then ticks the response-time collect loop + heartbeat loop + outbound WS loop until SIGTERM. Generic across deployments; per-install identity (server URL, cert pin, bearer) lives entirely in agent.conf.
- `agent/internal/transport/ws.go` — outbound WebSocket client using `gorilla/websocket`. NewWSDialer wires TLS pinning (same `pinned.TLSConfig` used by HTTP) + carries the bearer in subprotocol. RunWithReconnect loops Dial + Run with exponential-backoff + full-jitter; never gives up.
- `agent/internal/config/config.go` — Load/Save the INI-style agent.conf. Save() is atomic (write-tempfile + rename) and chmods 0600.
- `agent/internal/transport/client.go` — HTTP client that fires Enroll / PushSamples / Heartbeat / FetchConfig. Bearer stored on the Client struct; SetBearer() called once after enrollment.
- `agent/internal/pinned/tls.go` — VerifyPeerCertificate that compares the leaf SHA-256 against the pin from agent.conf. tls.Config has InsecureSkipVerify=true so the standard chain check (which consults system roots) is skipped — pin verification is the only thing that fires.
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts:POST /:id/agent/install` — create row in `pending` (stamping `installCredentialId` so the default uninstall path can reuse it); capture cert pin; emit `agent.install_kickoff`; fire `agentInstallService.startInstall` async (Phase 4a).
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts:DELETE /:id/agent` — synchronous revokeBearer + (force) hard-delete or (default) fire `agentInstallService.startUninstall` async; emits `agent.revoked` synchronously, then `agent.uninstalled` / `agent.uninstall_failed` from the async path.
- `src/services/agentInstallService.ts:startInstall` — async transport-aware install. SSH path: SFTP upload binary + conf + installer script to /tmp, `sudo -n bash` the installer. WinRM path: PowerShell installer via `-EncodedCommand`; the script downloads the binary over HTTPS from `/api/v1/agents/binary/:filename` with a cert-pin validation callback (no WS-Management Send verb needed). Both paths transition `pending → uploading → enrolling`. Failure lands as `installStatus="failed" + installError + agent.install_failed` event.
- `src/services/agentInstallService.ts:startUninstall` — async mirror per platform. SSH: SFTP upload uninstall script, run it. WinRM: PowerShell uninstaller via `-EncodedCommand` (Stop-Service + sc.exe delete + remove install dirs). On success hard-delete the ManagedAgent row + emit `agent.uninstalled`. Failure lands as `installStatus="uninstall_failed" + agent.uninstall_failed` warning.
- `src/utils/winrm.ts:winrmRunOne` — minimal WS-Management WinRS client. CreateShell → RunCommand → poll Receive until `CommandState=Done` → DeleteShell (always in finally). Used only by agentInstallService Windows path; not for monitoring probes (those use the lightweight Identify-only path in monitoringService.probeWinRm).
- `src/api/routes/agents.ts:agentsBinaryRouter` — `GET /api/v1/agents/binary/:filename`. Public, whitelist-checked against `data/agents/manifest.json` (only filenames the manifest declares for the current version are served; everything else 404s). Directory-traversal protected. Used by the WinRM install path so we don't need to implement chunked WS-Management Send-verb file upload.
- `public/js/assets.js:assetAgentSubpanelHTML` / `_wireAgentSubpanel` — System-tab Polaris Agent sub-panel renderer + button wiring. Visible only when the operator has expressed intent (an agent exists OR at least one per-asset *Polling column is "agent"). Auto-polls every 3 s while installStatus is one of pending / uploading / enrolling / uninstalling; stops when the modal closes (checked via the `#asset-agent-panel`'s `data-asset-id` sentinel).
- `public/js/assets.js:_openInstallAgentModal` — install modal using canonical `openModal(title, body, footerHTML)` + bound primary-button onclick (validation can hold the modal open). Cred picker filters Credential.type to "ssh" (linux/darwin) or "winrm" (windows) per OS selection; OS pre-fills from `Asset.os`.
- `public/js/assets.js:_confirmUninstallAgent` — wraps `showConfirm` Promise; on resolve(true) calls `api.assets.deleteAgent(id, {force})`.
- `src/api/routes/agents.ts:POST /enroll` — consumes the enrollment token, mints a long-lived bearer, transitions installStatus → "active"; emits `agent.enrolled`. Cert-pin mismatch sets installStatus="failed" and emits `agent.install_failed`.
- `src/api/routes/agents.ts:POST /samples` — bumps lastSeenAt (via verifyBearer) + lastTelemetryAt / lastSystemInfoAt per stream; calls recordProbeResult({fromAgent:true}) for the responseTime stream so the five-state machine runs on agent-pushed RTTs.
- `src/api/routes/agents.ts:POST /heartbeat` — refresh agentVersion + bump lastSeenAt.
- `src/services/agentTokenService.ts` — `mintEnrollmentToken` (10-min TTL), `consumeEnrollmentToken` (atomic swap → bearer), `revokeBearer` (sets bearerRevokedAt).

**Readers** (consume state):
- `src/api/middleware/auth.ts:requireAgentBearer` — verifies the bearer against the ManagedAgent token store and attaches `{managedAgentId, assetId}` to `req.managedAgent`. Used by every `/api/v1/agents/*` route except `/enroll`.
- `src/api/routes/agents.ts:GET /config` — resolves the asset's monitor settings via `resolveMonitorSettings` and returns the per-stream `enabled` (true when that stream is `polling==="agent"`), cadences, and timeouts; carries an ETag so the agent can short-circuit unchanged polls.
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:probeAsset / collectTelemetry / collectSystemInfo / collectFastFiltered` — early-return on agent-mode so the periodic puller doesn't touch hosts that the agent owns.
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:recordProbeResult` — agent-mode guard skipped only when `opts.fromAgent === true`.

**Invariants:**
- ManagedAgent.assetId is `@unique` — one agent install per asset. Reinstall is "delete row + new install."
- Bearer is bound to the assetId at issuance; the /samples handler stamps `req.managedAgent.assetId` server-side and ignores any client-supplied assetId on the wire.
- Cert pin is captured from the live HTTPS server at install kickoff via `httpsManager.getServerCertFingerprint()`. Install REFUSES when HTTPS isn't running (no cert to pin, no encrypted transport).
- Enrollment token is one-shot (consumed atomically) and TTL'd to 10 minutes. After consumption it's NULLed on the row; the install state moves to `active` and stays there until DELETE.
- `recordProbeResult` and `record*Result` early-return on agent-mode UNLESS `opts.fromAgent === true` — defends against the synthetic periodic-tick clobbering the agent's real signal.

**When changing this:**
- New sample stream: add Zod variant to `SamplesBodySchema`, map to enqueue helper, mirror in the Go agent collector (Phase 3+).
- New ManagedAgent column: update Prisma model + the route GET /:id/agent response shape (which strips hash fields explicitly).
- Cert-pin algorithm change: update `httpsManager.getServerCertFingerprint()` AND the Go agent's TLS verifier in lockstep — server pin AND agent pin both compute fingerprint the same way (sha256 of leaf DER).
- New /agents/* route: decide whether it's public (mount under `agentsEnrollRouter`) or bearer-gated (mount under `agentsRouter`). Both are wired in `src/api/router.ts` BEFORE the blanket `requireAuth` gate.

**Agent code changes MUST bump `agent/VERSION`.** The agent has its own
version string (decoupled from Polaris's version) tracked in the one-line
text file `agent/VERSION`. Any commit that touches files under
`agent/cmd/polaris-agent/`, `agent/internal/collectors/`,
`agent/internal/transport/`, `agent/internal/pinned/`, or `agent/go.mod`
MUST also bump `agent/VERSION` (semver: patch for fixes, minor for new
features, major for breaking wire-protocol changes). The version flows
through three places:

1. Stamped into the binary via `-ldflags='-X main.version=...'` so
   `polaris-agent` reports it and the agent's /heartbeat sends it as
   `ManagedAgent.agentVersion`.
2. Used as the directory name under `data/agents/<version>/` so a
   rebuild produces a new directory rather than overwriting the old
   binaries (the per-version cleanup helper retains a rollback target).
3. Compared by the auto-build job (`src/jobs/autoBuildAgents.ts`) at
   boot. The job fires Build ONLY when `manifest.currentVersion !==
   agent/VERSION` (and a manifest exists, and Go is installed, and the
   `agent.autoBuildOnVersionMismatch` Setting isn't false). Polaris
   patch releases that don't touch agent/ produce zero auto-build
   noise — the load-bearing decoupling.

Forgetting to bump VERSION means:
- The auto-build won't fire.
- Upgrade buttons on installed agents stay hidden (they compare
  `managedAgent.agentVersion` against `manifest.currentVersion`).
- Operators won't see the new behavior until they manually click Build.

When bumping `agent/go.mod`'s `go 1.x` directive, also bump the install
scripts' Go-version pin in `deploy/setup-{rhel,ubuntu,windows}{,-nodb}.{sh,ps1}`
and the Dockerfile's `golang-go` source (currently bookworm-backports)
in lockstep, or operators will get cryptic "missing go.sum entry"
errors when the build runs.

The rebuild + redistribute paths after bumping VERSION:
1. **From the UI:** Server Settings → Maintenance → Polaris Agent →
   Build. Polaris regenerates all 6 binaries using the installed Go
   toolchain. The auto-build job does this for you on the next server
   boot. Existing installed agents do NOT auto-upgrade — operators
   trigger that per-asset via the Upgrade button on the asset details
   modal OR fleet-wide via the "Upgrade all out-of-date" line on the
   Maintenance Polaris Agent card.
2. **From a shell:** `make -C agent all` then copy `dist/<version>/*`
   into `<STATE_DIR>/data/agents/<version>/` + update `manifest.json`.

## cross-cutting/polaris-agent-build

**What it is:** In-app build pipeline that produces the six platform
agent binaries (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64) and writes the
`manifest.json` consumed by the install/upgrade flows. Runs `go build`
directly in a child process (no `make` dependency — Windows hosts don't
ship GNU make). FIFO queue (depth 3) + per-build cancellation + post-
build auto-prune + boot-time auto-build are layered on top.

**Writers** (state that mutates):
- `src/services/agentBuildService.ts` — owns everything: state map,
  FIFO queue, mutex, per-build child-process handle, version reads,
  manifest writes, post-build prune. Exports:
  - `goAvailable()` — runs `go version`, no cache. UI / route gate on this.
  - `startBuild({actor})` — queues or runs immediately. 400 on no-Go,
    409 on queue-full (`BuildQueueFullError`). Emits `agent.build.started`
    (immediate) or `agent.build.queued` (enqueued).
  - `cancelBuild(buildId, actor)` — three branches: queued (splice from
    queue), in-flight (SIGTERM + SIGKILL after 5s grace, set
    `state.cancelled` so runBuild sees CancelledError), already-finished
    (`BuildAlreadyFinishedError` → route 409). Emits `agent.build.cancelled`.
  - `pruneOldAgentVersions()` — policy is keep-current + keep-in-use +
    keep-last-N (env `POLARIS_AGENT_KEEP_VERSIONS`, default 3). Fires
    after every successful build + on operator click of the Clean-up
    button on the Maintenance card. Emits `agent.versions.pruned` with
    `trigger: "post-build"|"manual"`.
- `src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts:/agents/*` — eight admin-only routes
  exposing the service: inventory, build start/poll/current/cancel,
  prune, installed-summary, upgrade-all, auto-build-setting GET+PUT.
- `src/jobs/autoBuildAgents.ts` — one-shot startup job, fires 60s after
  boot. Five gates in order: manifest exists, version drift, Go
  available, kill-switch off, then `startBuild({actor: "system:auto-
  build-on-version-change"})`. Emits `agent.build.auto_started` (info)
  or `agent.build.auto_skipped` (warning, with reason).
- `src/services/agentInstallService.ts:startUpgrade({managedAgentId,
  credentialId?, actor})` — SSH/WinRM-driven binary swap that preserves
  agent.conf. Transitions installStatus active → upgrading → active.
  Emits `agent.upgrade_kickoff`, `agent.upgrade_succeeded`,
  `agent.upgrade_failed`. The bulk path lives in
  `/server-settings/agents/upgrade-all` (Promise pool of 4 over eligible
  ManagedAgent rows).
- `src/utils/version.ts:getAgentVersion()` / `getAgentSourceDir()` —
  readers of `agent/VERSION` (not writers, but documenting here for
  proximity). 5s mtime-checked cache; format-validated; fallback
  `"0.0.0-no-version-file"`.
- `deploy/setup-{rhel,ubuntu,windows}{,-nodb}.{sh,ps1}` — install Go
  alongside Node + mkdir `$APP_DIR/data/agents` + `$APP_DIR/.cache/go-build`.
- `Dockerfile` — pulls `golang-go` from bookworm-backports; pre-creates
  `/app/state/.cache/go-build`.

**Readers** (consume state):
- `public/js/server-settings.js:initAgentBuildCard` — Maintenance-tab
  Polaris Agent card. Three states (inventory / progress / progress-
  queued-behind). Auto-poll every 2s while running. Sub-features:
  Upgrade-all line, Clean-up button, Auto-build toggle, × cancel buttons
  on in-flight + queued rows.
- `public/js/assets.js:assetAgentSubpanelHTML` — Upgrade button on
  active agents; Retry Upgrade on `upgrade_failed`. `_isTransientAgentState`
  includes `"upgrading"` so the existing 3s poll picks it up.
- `src/api/routes/agents.ts:agentsBinaryRouter` — `GET /api/v1/agents/binary/:filename`
  serves binaries the Build command produced. Whitelist-checked against
  the current manifest's `binaries` map.

**Invariants:**
- `agent/VERSION` (text file) is the single source of truth. `getAgentVersion()`
  reads it server-side; `agent/Makefile`'s `VERSION` directive reads it shell-side.
  Both feed the same `-ldflags '-X main.version=…'` flag so the in-binary version,
  the manifest's currentVersion, and the directory name all match.
- Single-slot active build + FIFO queue (depth 3). Queue overflow → 409;
  Go missing → 400.
- Per-platform `go build` invocations are serial. Parallel builds would
  thrash the shared GOCACHE for negligible wall-clock win.
- `manifest.json` is written atomically (write `.tmp` + rename) AFTER all
  six platforms succeed. Cancelled mid-flight builds leave a partial
  set under `data/agents/<version>/` but the existing manifest still
  points at the previous version's filenames.
- Prune helper NEVER touches the current version, NEVER touches versions
  in use by a live ManagedAgent (`installStatus !== "revoked"`), and
  ALWAYS keeps the most recent N (default 3, env `POLARIS_AGENT_KEEP_VERSIONS`).
- Auto-build refuses to fire on a fresh install (no manifest = operator
  hasn't opted in). Also refuses when Go isn't available (logs warning
  Event) or when `Setting.agent.autoBuildOnVersionMismatch === false`.
- Upgrade does NOT touch agent.conf. Bearer + cert pin survive; agent
  reconnects with the same identity after the binary swap.

**When changing this:**
- Adding a new platform/arch: extend `PLATFORMS` in `agentBuildService.ts`
  AND `manifest.binaries` shape in `agent/internal/transport/client.go`
  enroll request AND the install/upgrade script templates AND `Dockerfile`'s
  GOARCH support if shipping Polaris on that platform.
- Adding state to BuildState that isn't JSON-serializable: extend `publicView()`
  to drop it before returning to API consumers.
- Touching the install script templates: bump agent/VERSION so deployed
  agents pull the new bytes; the install path is templated server-side so
  changes ship via the next server release, not via agent rebuild.
- Adding a new upgrade-class action (e.g. config-only refresh): add it to
  `_isTransientAgentState` so the asset-details panel's auto-poll picks
  it up.

## cross-cutting/fmg-fortigate-parity-surfaces

**What it is:** FMG and standalone FortiGate integrations share feature surfaces that must move together: integration modal tabs (General / Filters / Monitoring / DHCP Push / Quarantine Push), transport dispatch via buildTransportForIntegration(), and filter helpers.

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — POST / PUT integration handlers parse both fortimanager and fortigate integration types, store config.pushReservations / pushQuarantine / monitorSettings / deviceInclude/Exclude in the same JSON shape
- `src/services/reservationPushService.ts:65-90` — buildTransportForIntegration() dispatches to FMG proxy/direct or FortiGate direct transport based on integration.type
- `src/services/assetQuarantineService.ts` — quarantineAsset() / releaseQuarantine() use buildTransportForIntegration() for both FMG and FortiGate
- `src/services/fortigateLocationService.ts` — fetchFortigateSysLocation() uses buildTransportForIntegration() + callFortiOs() for both FMG and FortiGate
- `src/services/fortigateCoordPushService.ts` — FMG-mode pushes to metavars + CMDB natively (no proxy); standalone pushes CMDB via direct REST. Same source-of-truth dispatch pattern as the other push services.
- `public/js/integrations.js:335-875` — Integration modal tab bodies for General (useProxy, Filters), Monitoring, DHCP Push, Quarantine Push. FortiGates Monitoring subtab now also carries the `pullSnmpLocation` / `pushGeocodedCoords` toggles.

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — Discovery sync paths read pushReservations toggle to decide whether to push DHCP changes
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — Discovery sync paths read pushQuarantine to decide whether to push quarantine entries
- `src/services/reservationService.ts` — Reserve/release flows call buildTransportForIntegration() to dispatch push/unpush calls
- `src/services/assetQuarantineService.ts` — Quarantine push consults buildTransportForIntegration() and pushQuarantine toggle
- `public/js/assets.js` — Asset details modal wires up quarantine/release buttons that call the quarantine endpoints
- `src/utils/integrationFilter.ts` — assetMatchesIntegrationFilter() checks deviceInclude/Exclude for FMG/FortiGate and ouInclude/Exclude for AD (not shared)

**Invariants:**
- FMG and FortiGate must have identical modal tab layouts and toggle names (pushReservations, pushQuarantine, monitorSettings JSON, deviceInclude/Exclude).
- buildTransportForIntegration() is the single source of truth for routing push/quarantine calls; all callers must use it, never inline a new transport builder.
- Standalone FortiGate always routes through direct REST transport (no proxy option); FMG respects the useProxy toggle on the General tab.
- DHCP Push and Quarantine Push are independent toggles; enabling one doesn't force the other (operators mix-and-match per deployment model).
- FMG-only features intentionally excluded from standalone FortiGate: multi-device device filter (ADOM scoping), FMG-proxy concurrency settings.
- Filter matching (deviceInclude/Exclude wildcards) is the same for both FMG and FortiGate; tested in integrationFilter.ts.

**When changing this:**
- Any modal tab change on FMG must be duplicated on standalone FortiGate (and vice versa); test both integration types.
- If adding a new transport capability, update buildTransportForIntegration() signature and all callers (reservationPushService, assetQuarantineService, future features).
- Check that toggle propagation works: set pushReservations=true on FMG and verify next discovery sync writes reservations; disable it and verify unpush/lease-release are skipped.
- Verify filter behavior: add a deviceInclude pattern to FMG and confirm the next sync only touches matching devices.
- Test cross-device push: one asset discovered by FMG with multiple device filters; confirm each push lands on the intended device via the transport.

## cross-cutting/asset-write-time-clamps-and-shadow-writes

**What it is:** Prisma extension in src/db.ts that automatically normalizes manufacturer, clamps acquiredAt, checks monitoring status, derives asset sources, and records IP history on every Asset create/update/upsert (see "Asset write-time clamps" in CLAUDE.md).

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/db.ts:224-302` — Extended client wraps asset.create/update/updateMany/upsert/delete with six hooks:
  - normalizeManufacturerInData() runs `Asset.manufacturer` through normalizeManufacturer()
  - clampMonitoredForStatus() forces monitored=false + resets consecutiveFailures when status ∈ {decommissioned, disabled}
  - recordIpHistory() upserts AssetIpHistory on ipAddress change
  - shadowWriteAssetSources() derives and upserts AssetSource rows when identity fields change
  - fireDnsResolvedReconcile() schedules a fire-and-forget per-asset reconcile of `dns_resolved` reservations (gated on writes that touch ipAddress / status / hostname / dnsName / macAddress)
  - fireDnsResolvedRelease() (delete branch only) releases any owned `dns_resolved` rows before the row is removed
- `src/utils/manufacturerNormalize.ts` — normalizeManufacturer() pure function (cached alias map, no DB access)
- `src/utils/assetInvariants.ts` — clampAcquiredToLastSeen() logic (not hooked yet; job applies it at startup)
- `src/utils/assetSourceDerivation.ts` — deriveAssetSources() pure function producing AssetSource rows from legacy tags
- `src/jobs/normalizeManufacturers.ts` — One-shot startup: seeds default aliases, loads cache, backfills existing Assets
- `src/jobs/clampAssetAcquiredAt.ts` — One-shot startup: clamps acquiredAt ≤ lastSeen for pre-existing rows

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- Any code path that writes to Asset (discovery, UI routes, jobs) gets the extension hooks applied automatically.
- `src/services/manufacturerAliasService.ts` — Manages the alias cache that normalizeManufacturer consults.
- `src/app.ts` — Warms the OUI / manufacturer alias cache at boot before any Asset writes occur.

**Invariants:**
- Every Asset create/update that touches manufacturer will have the value normalized by the alias map at write time (no raw "Fortinet, Inc." rows survive).
- clampAcquiredToLastSeen is gated by a marker key (job doesn't re-run); startup check will warn if marker is missing.
- IP history is fire-and-forget best-effort; a transient DB error doesn't block the underlying Asset write.
- shadowWriteAssetSources uses the same derivation rules as the backfill job; updates only refresh metadata (syncedAt, lastSeen, integrationId), never overwrite observed JSON that came from discovery.
- updateMany doesn't trigger shadowWriteAssetSources (rare on identity fields; backfill catches drift on next startup).
- Extension runs AFTER the query executes; result reflects the DB commit state, not pre-normalization input.

**When changing this:**
- New clamps must be added to BOTH normalizeManufacturerInData() (for manufacturer) AND clampMonitoredForStatus() branches, preserving order (normalize first, clamp second, then shadow-write).
- If bypass paths exist (raw SQL, stored procedures, external scripts), they MUST be audited and manually corrected via startup jobs (extension can't intercept).
- Test the order: create an asset with status=decommissioned, monitored=true, consecutiveFailures=5; verify monitored flips to false and counter resets.
- Verify alias cache is warmed: set a new alias, restart the app, create an asset with the old name; spot-check it got normalized.
- Check IP history on duplicate IP: same asset, new source; verify firstSeen was reset (CASE expression in SQL working) and lastSeen bumped.

## cross-cutting/reservation-push-lifecycle

**What it is:** Two-way DHCP reservation ↔ FortiGate sync via pushReservations toggle on FMG/FortiGate integrations, sourceType flip (manual → dhcp_reservation on success), pushedScopeId/pushedEntryId tracking, and lease-release on free.

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/services/reservationPushService.ts:65-200` — buildTransportForIntegration() + pushReservationEntry() upsert / read-back verify on FortiOS
- `src/services/reservationService.ts:245` — On successful push, set sourceType = "dhcp_reservation", pushedToId, pushedScopeId, pushedEntryId, pushedAt
- `src/services/reservationService.ts:340-390` — releaseReservation() unpushes using pushedScopeId/pushedEntryId, then lease-releases (dhcp_lease rows) if integration has pushReservations=true
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:2559,2733,2783,2847,2919` — upsertConflict() bypass when existingRes.sourceType === "manual" (don't conflict-flag pre-existing manual reservations)
- `public/js/assets.js` — Quarantine/release UI buttons (quarantine push separate from reservation push)

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- `src/services/reservationService.ts` — Lease release reads dhcp_lease sourceType rows and filters to those pushed by this integration
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — Discovery sync reads pushReservations toggle to gate DHCP reservation creation
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — upsertDhcpReservation() checks if existingRes.sourceType==="manual"; if so, calls upsertConflict() instead of auto-updating
- `public/js/assets.js` — UI shows pushStatus ("synced" / "drift") + pushedAt timestamp on manual reservation rows that have pushedToId set

**Invariants:**
- DHCP reservations are MAC→IP pairs; only per-IP (not full-subnet) manual reservations are push-eligible.
- pushedScopeId + pushedEntryId are resolved AT PUSH TIME and pinned; used at unpush without re-querying the FortiGate.
- sourceType flip to "dhcp_reservation" is ONLY set on successful push; if push fails, no Polaris row is created (fail-on-failure semantics).
- Lease release happens ONLY for dhcp_lease sourceType rows where the originating integration's pushReservations=true.
- pushStatus ∈ {"synced", "drift"}; "synced" = verified on device, "drift" = was synced, missing on re-discovery.
- upsertConflict() bypass (sourceType==="manual" check) prevents false conflicts when discovery touches a manual reservation (operator created it before this integration, now discovery found it too).

**When changing this:**
- Verify pushedScopeId/pushedEntryId survive across restarts: create a reservation, restart the app, release it; confirm unpush hits the exact device-side entry.
- Test sourceType flip: create a manual reservation, push succeeds; verify sourceType is now "dhcp_reservation" and pushedToId is set to the integration.
- Check conflict bypass: create a manual reservation, add an integration that discovers the same IP; verify conflict is raised only for non-manual priors.
- Lease-release cadence: toggle pushReservations off mid-deployment, release a dhcp_lease row; confirm unpush is skipped but the Polaris row is freed.
- Verify read-back verify: FortiGate DHCP create succeeds but the verify read fails (transient device timeout); confirm the push is retried or fails cleanly.

## cross-cutting/fortigate-snmp-location-and-coord-writeback

**What it is:** Discovery-time SNMP sysLocation pull (via REST `GET /api/v2/cmdb/system.snmp/sysinfo`) → Nominatim geocode → `Asset.snmpLocation` / `Asset.latitude` / `Asset.longitude` for FMG/standalone-FortiGate-discovered firewalls. Optional opt-in write-back closes the loop: when the geocoded coords don't match what's currently in the FortiGate's CMDB GUI fields, Polaris pushes the new values to FMG metavars (`Latitude` / `Longitude`) AND CMDB (`gui-device-*`) for FMG mode, or just CMDB for standalone. Gated by two per-integration toggles in `fortigateMonitor`: `pullSnmpLocation` (master enable) and `pushGeocodedCoords` (write-back, disabled when pull is off).

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/services/fortigateLocationService.ts` — fetchFortigateSysLocation() returns trimmed sysLocation string or null. REST-only, reuses callFortiOs + buildTransportForIntegration so it works in both FMG proxy and direct mode (and doesn't need network reachability to the FortiGate's mgmt IP when in proxy mode).
- `src/services/geocoderService.ts` — geocode() with positive+negative `GeocodeCache` (90-day TTL) + 1 req/sec rate limiter (module-level chained Promise). Transport failures do NOT poison the cache; only successful responses write rows. Never throws.
- `src/services/fortigateCoordPushService.ts` — pushCoordsToFortigate() dispatches BOTH metavars + CMDB writes (FMG mode) or CMDB only (standalone). Best-effort: per-target failures collected in the returned `{ok, targets[], error?}` shape, never thrown.
- `src/services/fortimanagerService.ts:setFmgDeviceMetaFields` + `setFmgDeviceCmdbGuiCoords` — native FMG `update` helpers used by the push service. Both go through the worker's native lane (no proxy throttle).
- `src/services/fortimanagerService.ts:extractMetavarCoordsFromFmgDevice` — parses `Latitude` / `Longitude` metavars from FMG `/dvmdb/adom/<adom>/device` records when the list query carries `option: ["get meta"]`. Surfaces as `DiscoveredDevice.metavarLatitude` / `metavarLongitude`.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:syncDhcpSubnets` Phase 3 — Once per device (NOT per HA member), gated on `pullSnmpLocation`: pulls sysLocation, geocodes it, stashes results into the per-device closure variables (`devSnmpLocation` / `devSnmpLocationFetchedAt` / `devGeocodedLat` / `devGeocodedLng`). Each per-member `memberDevice` build carries these forward into the observed blob via buildFortigateFirewallObservedBlob. `updateData.snmpLocation` / `updateData.snmpLocationFetchedAt` are stamped on every Asset update + create. Write-back call fires AFTER the per-member loop (so all member Asset writes have landed) — only when geocoding succeeded AND `coordsClose(geocoded, cmdb, 1e-5)` returns false. Emits `integration.coords.pushed` or `integration.coords.push_failed` Events.
- `src/utils/assetProjection.ts:LATITUDE_RULES` / `LONGITUDE_RULES` / `SNMP_LOCATION_RULES` — three-tier coord priority on the `fortigate-firewall` source: snmpGeocoded → metavar → CMDB. Each picker validates the full (lat,lng) pair via `isValidGeoCoord` so a half-valid tier falls through to the next instead of mixing tiers. `snmpLocation` is a separate projected string field.
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — Asset.snmpLocation / Asset.snmpLocationFetchedAt columns; GeocodeCache model.

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- `public/js/assets.js:2538` — Renders "SNMP Location" viewRow on asset details General tab when `a.snmpLocation` is set.
- `public/js/integrations.js` — FortiGate Monitoring subtab renders the two toggles via `_fortigateAddMonitoredHTML`; `_readFortigateMonitorBlock` reads them on Save. `pushGeocodedCoords` is force-cleared client-side when `pullSnmpLocation` is off (matches the inline onchange UI handler that disables the push checkbox when pull flips off).
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:FortiGateClassMonitorSchema` — Zod schema for the persisted shape (`pullSnmpLocation: boolean`, `pushGeocodedCoords: boolean`).
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts` — Asset findUnique / findMany returns snmpLocation + snmpLocationFetchedAt naturally (no field whitelist filters them out).
- `src/api/routes/map.ts` — Device Map endpoints read `Asset.latitude` / `Asset.longitude` (which projection resolves through the SNMP-first chain when pull is on) for pin placement. No special handling — just consumes the resolved values.

**Invariants:**
- SNMP location pull is ALWAYS via REST (`/api/v2/cmdb/system.snmp/sysinfo`), never via net-snmp. This sidesteps the SNMP credential resolver and works in FMG proxy mode where Polaris can't reach the FortiGate's mgmt IP directly.
- The pull fires ONCE per FortiGate per discovery cycle — HA cluster members share sysLocation by physical co-location, so the result is reused across all members' observed blobs.
- When geocoding fails (empty sysLocation, no Nominatim hit, transport error), the asset's lat/lng falls through to the metavar tier and then to CMDB. `Asset.snmpLocation` is still populated with the raw string whenever the REST pull returned one — operators see "what the FortiGate is telling SNMP" independent of geocode outcome.
- `Asset.snmpLocationFetchedAt` is stamped whenever the REST pull was attempted, even when it returned empty string (lets the UI show "checked X minutes ago, no value reported").
- `coordsClose` tolerance is 1e-5° (~1.1 m at the equator). Tighter than Nominatim's typical 6-7 decimal output for street addresses — catches actual operator edits without firing on Nominatim re-geocode jitter.
- Write-back fires ONCE per FortiGate (not per HA member — coord write is cluster-wide).
- FMG-mode write-back lands in FMG's CMDB but does NOT trigger an FMG install. The live FortiGate sees the change only when an operator runs Install Device Configuration in FMG. UI text on the toggle surfaces this caveat.
- `pushGeocodedCoords` is force-cleared (client AND server side) when `pullSnmpLocation` is off — operators can't push what they aren't pulling.
- GeocodeCache stores BOTH positive and negative results (null lat/lng = "Nominatim returned no match"). Transport failures (timeout / non-2xx / parse error) are NOT cached — only the upstream's response writes a row, so a transient Nominatim outage doesn't poison subsequent retries.
- Geocoder rate limiter is process-global (module-level chained Promise), 1 req/sec. Cache hits bypass the gate entirely so steady-state cycles after the initial fleet pass are near-zero requests.
- Both toggles default OFF on a fresh install AND on existing integrations. No behavior change unless an operator opts in.

**When changing this:**
- Verify existing-install no-op: leave both toggles off on a fleet with valid CMDB coords. Discover. Confirm zero REST sysLocation calls, zero Nominatim requests, Asset coords unchanged.
- Test the SNMP-first override: set CMDB coords valid, set `sysLocation` to a different real address, enable `pullSnmpLocation` (push off). Discover. Verify Asset coords now come from geocoded sysLocation; CMDB unchanged on the FortiGate.
- Test write-back parity: enable both toggles on an FMG integration. Confirm BOTH metavars (`Latitude` / `Longitude`) AND CMDB (`gui-device-latitude` / `gui-device-longitude`) get updated. Repeat for standalone — confirm CMDB only (no metavars on standalone). Verify the FMG-side change requires operator Install to reach the live FortiGate (Polaris does not trigger installs).
- Test cache hit + negative cache: re-discover with same sysLocation → no Nominatim request. Set sysLocation to gibberish → row exists with null lat/lng → next discovery doesn't re-hit upstream.
- Test rate limiter: kick off a discovery against ≥5 FortiGates with distinct unseen sysLocations. Confirm Nominatim requests are spaced ≥1 second apart.
- Test HA cluster: SNMP pull fires ONCE per cluster; write-back also fires ONCE (not per member). Both members' AssetSource observed blobs carry the same `snmpLocation` / `snmpGeocodedLatitude` / `snmpGeocodedLongitude`.
- Test the tolerance: set CMDB coords ~1m off from geocoded → match, no write-back. Set CMDB ~10m off → mismatch, write-back fires.
- Test toggle gating: flip `pullSnmpLocation` off in the modal; verify `pushGeocodedCoords` checkbox auto-disables AND auto-clears. Re-enable pull; verify push stays unchecked until operator ticks it explicitly.
- Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` — the assetProjection test suite covers the projection shape and will fail loudly if new projected fields aren't added to the all-null baseline expectation.

## cross-cutting/dns-resolved-reservations

**What it is:** Auto-created Reservation rows with `sourceType="dns_resolved"` + `createdBy="system:dns-resolved"` for every Asset whose primary `ipAddress` falls inside a non-deprecated Subnet and isn't already covered by an authoritative reservation. Closes the gap where an AD / Entra / Intune / manually-typed asset's IP is invisible in the Networks IP panel and could be handed out twice. Observational only — never pushes to FortiGates, never raises Conflict rows, silently defers to manual / dhcp_* / interface_ip / vip / fortinet rows.

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/services/dnsResolvedReservationService.ts` — `reconcileDnsResolvedForAsset(assetId)` is the single per-asset upsert/release path. Exports `reconcileDnsResolvedForAllAssets()` (sweep), `releaseDnsResolvedForAsset(assetId)` (asset-delete), `releaseDnsResolvedAt(subnetId, ipAddress)` (discovery hand-off).
- `src/db.ts` — Prisma extension fires `fireDnsResolvedReconcile(result.id)` after every gated `asset.create` / `asset.update` / `asset.upsert`; fires `fireDnsResolvedRelease(args.where.id)` BEFORE `asset.delete` runs so the service can still read the row's hostname/MAC to identify owned reservation rows.
- `src/jobs/reconcileDnsResolvedReservations.ts` — 30-min tick + 30s post-boot kick. Sweeps every asset with `ipAddress != null` in batches of 25 via Promise.all.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` (`syncDhcpSubnets`) — `activeResMap` construction EXCLUDES `sourceType="dns_resolved"` rows so discovery treats the IP as free; the five `prisma.reservation.create` callsites (fortiswitch / fortinap / vip / interface_ip / dhcp_*) each call `releaseDnsResolvedAt(subnetId, ip)` inline before creating.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` (`registerFortinetHost`) — findFirst excludes dns_resolved + same inline release before create.
- `src/services/reservationService.ts` (`createReservation`) — manual create's existing-active-reservation check excludes dns_resolved; calls `releaseDnsResolvedAt` inline before the `$transaction`.

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- `public/js/ip-panel.js:282-347` — recognizes `r.sourceType === "dns_resolved"` to render a distinct "DNS Resolved" status pill and tooltip. The Reserve/Free/Edit button gating is unchanged — `createdBy === "system:dns-resolved"` doesn't match any user, so non-admin operators see view-only.
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts:buildIpContexts` — `ipContext.reservation.sourceType` carries the value through to the assets list's View Lease deep-link target; no special handling needed (the deep link just opens the IP panel which renders the badge).

**Invariants:**
- Reservation `@@unique([subnetId, ipAddress, status])` constraint requires the inline release before any authoritative create at the same target. Never skip it.
- `createdBy="system:dns-resolved"` is the stable system actor — the existing ownership middleware treats `system:*` as "no operator owns this", which is the intended UX (non-admins can't edit).
- Eligible asset statuses: active / maintenance / storage / quarantined. decommissioned / disabled MUST release the existing row (don't keep stale claims).
- IPv4 only (Netmask helpers are IPv4-only and the IP-panel UI is IPv4-shaped). IPv6 assets silently skip.
- Never push to FortiGate. The service writes via raw `prisma.reservation.create` and bypasses `reservationService.createReservation` so the push path is never reachable.
- Never raise Conflict rows. The defer-to-authoritative branch returns early without touching `prisma.conflict`.
- Real-time hook is best-effort fire-and-forget — the periodic job is the safety net.

**When changing this:**
- Adding a new authoritative `sourceType`? Add a `releaseDnsResolvedAt(subnetId, ip)` call inline before every place that creates rows with the new value, and verify the activeResMap construction still excludes dns_resolved only.
- Adding a new eligibility column (e.g. asset's site/zone)? Update `assetEligible()` AND the `findOwnedSystemRows` identity match (MAC + hostname) — if the identity key changes, stale rows orphan instead of releasing.
- Switching ownership to a real FK (Reservation.assetId)? Drop the identity-match heuristic and join directly; the periodic job becomes trivially correct.
- Performance check at 2000 assets: the periodic job's batched Promise.all should complete in a few seconds. If it grows, increase the batch size (25 → 50) before fanning out further — the bottleneck is the `findContainingSubnet` $queryRaw, not the Asset findMany.
- IPv6 follow-up: `findContainingSubnet` already uses Postgres `inet`/`cidr` containment which supports v6; the gate is `detectIpVersion(ip) === "v4"` in `assetEligible()`. Removing it would also need a v6-aware containment check in `ipInCidr` callers.

## cross-cutting/asset-tag-mutators

**What it is:** Anything in the codebase that writes `Asset.tags`. The `tags: String[]` column is used by humans (assets-page filtering, search) AND by features that "stamp" managed tags (e.g. `region:<name>` from map regions). Two writer classes coexist: **operator-driven** (asset edit modal, bulk-edit) and **system-driven** (auto-tagging features). The latter must be careful not to step on operator-set values.

**Operator writers:**
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts:PUT /assets/:id` — primary edit path; accepts `tags: string[]` and writes it as-is.
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts:POST /assets/:id/sources/:sourceId/split` — clones tag set when splitting an asset.
- `public/js/assets.js` bulk-edit modal — calls `PUT /assets/:id` per row with "Add" / "Replace" semantics.

**System writers (managed namespaces):**
- `src/services/mapRegionService.ts` — owns the `region:` prefix. Adds `region:<name>` to in-polygon firewalls + cascaded FortiSwitches/FortiAPs; only strips on rename/delete (never on polygon edit). Sees its own tags via the prefix; never touches operator-set tags. Mirrored to the `Tag` registry under category "Map Regions".
- `src/services/firewallTagService.ts` — owns the `firewall:` prefix. Reconciles `firewall:<hostname>` on every FortiSwitch / FortiAP / non-infra endpoint at end of FMG / FortiGate discovery (Phase 13.5) using `Asset.fortinetTopology.controllerFortigate` + `AssetFortigateSighting` rows within `sightingMaxAgeDays`. Strips only tags whose hostname is one of THIS integration's currently-known firewalls (cross-integration safe). Inline lifecycle hooks at Phase 2a (decommission strip), Phase 3 firewall create (registry seed), Phase 3 firewall update (rename rotation). Mirrored to the `Tag` registry under category "FortiGate".
- Discovery breadcrumb tags — `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` legacy paths still write `entra-disabled`, `ad-disabled`, `prev-*` markers. Some of these (sid:, ad-guid:) are being retired by the multi-source asset model.

**Tag registry mirror (`prisma.tag` rows):**
- Manual tag pickers (assets edit modal) read from the registry to populate dropdowns. System-managed tags should also appear here so operators can search/filter for them — `mapRegionService` is the canonical example (upserts on create, rotates on rename, deletes on delete).

**Invariants:**
- A managed tag prefix must be **owned** by exactly one writer. Don't add a second feature that writes `region:*` — pick a different prefix.
- System writers must be additive in the steady state. Stripping a tag because "the asset doesn't fall in the polygon any more" is a footgun unless the operator explicitly requested that semantic (rename/delete, not polygon edit).
- Manual operator attachments to system-managed tags (e.g. an endpoint server hand-tagged `region:Atlanta`) must survive periodic reconcilers.

**When changing this:**
- New auto-tagging feature? Pick a prefix, document it here, mirror to the `Tag` registry, and follow the additive-reconciler pattern from `mapRegionService`.
- Removing a managed prefix? Audit existing rows for stale tags before retiring the writer.
- Changing the `Asset.tags` column type or moving tags to a side table? Every writer in this section needs to migrate — the `String[]` shape is load-bearing.

## cross-cutting/dependency-aware-monitoring-suppression

**What it is:** AssetDependencyParent edges + Asset.dependencyLayer + Asset.dependencySuppressed coupled to the response-time five-state machine. Parent (FortiGate / upstream switch) confirmed-down → all transitive descendants pause heavy cadences and slow probe to 2× interval; recovery resumes within one base-cadence tick. "All-down" multi-parent semantics — a switch with redundant uplinks suppresses only when every effective parent is down or itself suppressed.

**Writers** (files that mutate or emit this state):
- `src/services/dependencyTreeService.ts` — recomputeDependencyTree() rebuilds source="computed" rows in AssetDependencyParent + Asset.dependencyLayer at end of every FMG/FortiGate discovery cycle. Source="override" rows are operator-managed (admin override endpoints — to be added in API commit) and never touched by recompute.
- `src/services/dependencyTreeService.ts` — reconcileDependencySuppression() is the source of truth for Asset.dependencySuppressed; emits monitor.dependency_suppressed / monitor.dependency_resumed Events on transitions.
- `src/services/dependencyTreeService.ts` — propagateAfterStatusChange() is the latency-optimization hook called from recordProbeResult after every monitor.status_changed Event.
- `src/jobs/dependencyReconciler.ts` — 60s tick that calls reconcileDependencySuppression(); the source of truth catches anything the event hook missed.
- `src/jobs/backfillDependencyTree.ts` — one-shot startup runs recomputeDependencyTree() so existing installs see populated rows without waiting 4h.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — Phase 12 of syncDhcpSubnets calls recomputeDependencyTree(integrationId) on mode in {full, finalize}.

**Readers** (files that consume it):
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:runMonitorPass()` — Cadence dispatch: heavy cadences gated on `monitorStatus==="up" && !dependencySuppressed`; probe interval doubles when dependencySuppressed AND responseTimePolling !== "disabled".
- `src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts:publishDueWork()` — Same gate, mirrored for the pg-boss publisher path.
- `public/js/assets.js:assetMonitorBadge()` — Status pill renders slate-blue "Dep. Down" when `dependencySuppressed && monitorStatus !== "down"` (probe-down wins over the suppressed flag — the probe is the proof).
- `public/js/map.js:monitorClass()` / `clusterIcon()` / `fortigateNodeColor()` — Pin/cluster/topology-node colors render slate-blue (`monitor-dep-down`) under the same priority rule. Cluster aggregation rolls up to dep-down only when no child has a worse probe-direct status.
- `public/js/mobile/asset-detail.js:renderMonitorPill()` / `monitorDotCls()` — Same priority + slate-blue treatment on the mobile asset-detail surface.
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts` — Three endpoints: `GET /assets/:id/dependencies`, `PUT /:id/dependencies/override` (admin, with cycle validation), `DELETE /:id/dependencies/override` (admin).
- `src/api/routes/assets.ts:GET /` and `GET /:id` — Stamps `dependencyLayer` + `dependencySuppressed` on every asset returned so the pill renderer doesn't need a second fetch.
- `src/api/routes/map.ts:GET /sites` and `GET /sites/:id/topology` — Stamps the same fields on each pin / topology node. (The topology endpoint still computes edges via per-request BFS through `interfaceTopologyService` — full DAG-as-source-of-truth refactor is a follow-up; current state is "DAG drives suppression, BFS still drives graph rendering.")

**Invariants:**
- Suppression follows the **confirmed-down** edge only. monitor.status_changed Event fires solely on up↔down transitions, and propagateAfterStatusChange() is called only from that same emission point. Warning / recovering flapping does NOT propagate.
- "All-down" multi-parent: an asset with N effective parents suppresses iff every parent is down or itself dependencySuppressed. Empty parent set = never suppressed.
- Override resolution: if any source="override" row exists for an asset, those are the effective parents (computed rows ignored). Empty override set = explicit "no parents" pin (asset opts out entirely).
- Unmonitored parents are transparent — the suppression walk skips them and continues to their grandparents. A monitored ancestor must say "down" before suppression can fire.
- recomputeDependencyTree only touches source="computed" rows for in-scope assets; out-of-scope rows and source="override" rows are never deleted.
- Layer assignment is BFS shortest-path from any FortiGate (layer 1). Cycles, disconnected subgraphs, or chains through unmonitored intermediates may leave dependencyLayer = null.
- Reconciler runs in BFS layer order so parent's effective state is settled before children evaluate (otherwise multi-tier suppression could oscillate).

**When changing this:**
- Mirror cadence-dispatch changes in BOTH src/services/monitoringService.ts AND src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts. The two are parallel implementations and must stay in lock-step.
- Verify the propagateAfterStatusChange() hook still fires only from the up↔down emission point — never from warning/recovering churn.
- Run the dependencyTreeService.test.ts suite — covers BFS layers, MCLAG siblings, dual-homed multi-parent, all-down semantics, transparent unmonitored parents, confirmed-down-only edge.
- Smoke-test on dev: pick a live FortiGate, set monitorStatus="down" via direct DB write, wait one reconciler tick (≤60s); confirm child switches/APs flip to dependencySuppressed and emit monitor.dependency_suppressed Events.
- If the topology endpoint refactor lands: hit /api/v1/map/sites/:id/topology before/after; edge sets must match (same FG→switch / switch→AP edges) modulo the new dependencySuppressed flag on each node.
- Watch for cycles introduced by override edits: the override endpoint must reject inputs that would form a cycle (BFS-back-walk validation).

## cross-cutting/verbose-debug-mode

**What it is:** A per-integration `config.verboseLogging` boolean that, when true, surfaces step-by-step discovery + sync + monitor-worker logs to pino at info level (tagged `verbose: true`) so an operator can `journalctl -u polaris -f` and watch one integration's behavior in real time. Off by default; toggled per integration from the edit modal.

**The four touchpoints** (changing any one requires keeping the others consistent):

1. **Integration config schemas** ([src/api/routes/integrations.ts](src/api/routes/integrations.ts)) — every integration type's Zod schema (`FortiManagerConfigSchema`, `FortiGateConfigSchema`, `WindowsServerConfigSchema`, `EntraIdConfigSchema`, `ActiveDirectoryConfigSchema`) carries `verboseLogging: z.boolean().optional().default(false)`. New integration types added in the future must follow the same pattern.

2. **Discovery `onProgress` consumer** ([src/api/routes/integrations.ts](src/api/routes/integrations.ts) `onProgress` closure inside the discover route) — reads `integration.config.verboseLogging` once at discovery start. When true, every callback emits `logger.info({ verbose: true, integrationId, integrationName, step, level, device }, message)` in addition to the existing `logEvent()`.

3. **Sync phase markers** ([src/api/routes/integrations.ts](src/api/routes/integrations.ts) `syncDhcpSubnets` — `phaseMark(name)` helper) — when verbose is on, each `phaseMark()` call logs the elapsed time of the previous phase + starts the new phase's timer. A final `phaseMark("__end__")` closes the last phase right before the function returns.

4. **Worker handlers** ([src/services/queueService.ts](src/services/queueService.ts) `runDedicatedWorker` and `dispatchFloatingJob`) — read `job.data.verboseDebug` (stamped by the publisher in `monitorAssets.publishDueWork` when `discoveredByIntegration.config.verboseLogging === true`). When true, emit `monitor.worker.pickup` on entry + `monitor.worker.finish` on exit, with slot id, jobId, cadence, assetId, outcome, elapsedMs.

**Worker slot id scheme:** [src/utils/workerSlotPool.ts](src/utils/workerSlotPool.ts) hands out `<prefix>-W01..NN` for dedicated cadence pools (probe / fast / telemetry / sysinfo) and `floating-F01..NN` for the floating pool. Slot acquired on handler entry, released on exit so the same slot is reused across jobs — operators can trace one slot's lifecycle through journalctl. Slot bookkeeping runs every tick regardless of verbose mode; only the *logging* of slot ids is gated on the flag.

**Structured log payload contract:** every verbose line emits these fields — `verbose: true`, `integrationId` + `integrationName` (when scoped to an integration), `step` or `phase` (for discovery/sync), `workerSlot` + `jobId` + `cadence` (for workers), `assetId`, `elapsedMs` (when measured), `outcome` (for worker.finish: `"success" | "failure"`). The contract is what makes `journalctl -o json | jq 'select(.verbose==true)'` filtering work reliably; do not strip these fields when adding a new verbose log call.

**When changing this:**
- Adding a new integration type → add `verboseLogging` to its config schema, its frontend form helper, its `getXxxFormConfig` reader, and a Debug section to its General tab. See the 5 existing pairs for the template.
- Adding a new discovery step → it inherits verbose logging for free via the existing `onProgress` route. No code change required if the step uses the standard callback.
- Adding a new pg-boss queue → add a slot pool entry in `startPgbossWorkers` and use `runDedicatedWorker` (or pattern-match `dispatchFloatingJob`) so pickup/finish lines land for free.
- Adding a new sync phase → insert one `phaseMark("X")` call right under the `// Phase X — ...` comment. The previous phase's elapsed time is logged at the next phaseMark call; the final phase is closed by the `phaseMark("__end__")` at the bottom of `syncDhcpSubnets`.

## cross-cutting/pgbouncer-compatibility

**What it is:** Polaris is **PgBouncer-aware**. Operators who put PgBouncer (or any connection multiplexer) in front of PostgreSQL set `POLARIS_DB_DIRECT_URL` to the direct Postgres URL while `DATABASE_URL` points at PgBouncer. Polaris routes different code paths to one URL or the other based on what each path needs.

**Connection-string helpers** (`src/utils/dbConnections.ts`):
- `getApplicationDatabaseUrl()` — returns DATABASE_URL.
- `getDirectDatabaseUrl()` — returns POLARIS_DB_DIRECT_URL when set, else falls back to DATABASE_URL.
- `getDbConnectionMode()` — returns `"pgbouncer"` when the two URLs differ OR DATABASE_URL has `?pgbouncer=true`; `"direct"` otherwise.

**Routing rules:**
- **Application queries (Prisma client)** → DATABASE_URL via `src/db.ts`. Under PgBouncer this hits the multiplexer; under direct mode it hits Postgres straight.
- **pg-boss queue ops** → `getDirectDatabaseUrl()` in `src/services/queueService.ts:startPgbossWorkers`. Required: pg-boss uses LISTEN/NOTIFY and the pg client's prepared-statement cache, both of which break under PgBouncer transaction pooling.
- **`pg_dump` backup + restore** → `getDirectDatabaseUrl()` in `src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts` (`/database/backup` and `/database/restore` routes). PgBouncer doesn't proxy the COPY-heavy dump protocol reliably.
- **`pg_stat_activity` reads** → dedicated `pg.Pool` (max 2) in `src/services/capacityService.ts:getDirectStatsPool()`, opened lazily only when PgBouncer mode is detected. Going through PgBouncer would show the multiplexed view of backend connections, which under-counts what Polaris actually holds.
- **express-session** → DATABASE_URL (PgBouncer-safe; low-volume INSERT/SELECT/DELETE with no LISTEN/NOTIFY, no held prepared statements).
- **Prisma CLI migrations** → operator concern. The in-app updater inherits whatever DATABASE_URL is set; CLI invocations under PgBouncer should explicitly set `DATABASE_URL=<direct URL>` before `npx prisma migrate deploy`. Documented in `docs/INSTALL.md`.

**Detection signal:** `polaris_db_connection_mode{mode}` gauge (set once at boot from `recordDbConnectionMode()` in `src/app.ts`) plus an info-level log line at boot. Operators verify Polaris recognized their topology without grepping for connection errors.

**Capacity Advisor caveat:** The advisor's `PG_MAX_CONNECTIONS` recommendation is sized to keep Polaris's pool at ≤65% of `max_connections`. Under PgBouncer mode this is a conservative upper bound — PgBouncer's `default_pool_size` × pool count is what actually hits Postgres, so a smaller `max_connections` is fine. UI shows a hint ("PgBouncer detected") above the recommendation table when applicable; the underlying math stays the same.

**When changing this:**
- Adding a new code path that issues `LISTEN`, `NOTIFY`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, or any session-scoped state-machine SQL: route it through `getDirectDatabaseUrl()` so it doesn't break PgBouncer installs.
- Adding a new code path that reads `pg_stat_activity` for cluster-wide stats: route it through `getDirectStatsPool()` so the numbers are accurate.
- Routine read/write through Prisma: leave it alone. The application URL is the right path.

## cross-cutting/schema-migrations-and-prisma-client-lifecycle

**What it is:** The contract between `prisma/schema.prisma`, the generated Prisma client at `src/generated/prisma/` (gitignored), the compiled `dist/generated/prisma/`, and the in-app updater pipeline that holds them together. Polaris uses Prisma 7 with `provider = "prisma-client"` which emits TypeScript source — `prisma generate` writes to `src/generated/prisma/`, then `tsc` compiles to `dist/generated/prisma/`. The running process imports from `./generated/prisma/client.js` (see `src/db.ts:30`). The state the running process holds in memory must match the actual DB schema, or every Prisma query that selects the affected columns crashes with `column "<name>" does not exist`.

**Lifecycle (steps must execute in this order):**
1. **Schema edit** — `prisma/schema.prisma` is the source of truth for what the Prisma client knows about.
2. **Migration written** — `prisma/migrations/<ts>_<name>/migration.sql` describes how to evolve the DB from the previous shape to the new one.
3. **Generate** — `npx prisma generate` writes a fresh `src/generated/prisma/`. Triggered by the `postinstall` script in `package.json` after `npm install` / `npm ci`, AND by an explicit step in `applyUpdate` (since postinstall can be silently skipped — `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, partial install recovery, etc.).
4. **Compile** — `npx tsc` produces `dist/`. `dist/` must be cleaned first (`rm -rf dist`) because tsc is non-destructive: stale `.js` files from a prior generation can shadow the regenerated client if Prisma changed its internal file layout (the `prisma-client` provider's auxiliary files do this between minor versions).
5. **Migrate** — `npx prisma migrate deploy` applies pending SQL.
6. **Restart** — the running process picks up the new client + the new schema together.

**Writers** (files that drive each step):
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — schema source of truth.
- `prisma/migrations/*/migration.sql` — DB evolution.
- `package.json:postinstall` — calls `prisma generate` after deps install.
- `src/services/updateService.ts:applyUpdate` — orchestrates steps 3-6 in `cross-cutting/services/updateService.ts`'s seven-step pipeline.
- `prisma.config.ts` — Prisma 7 config (datasource URL, generator output path).

**Readers** (code that depends on the lifecycle's invariants holding):
- **All Prisma typed queries** (`prisma.asset.update`, `findMany`, etc.) — generated client decides which columns appear in `SELECT` / `RETURNING` clauses. A stale client crashes on any query that touches a dropped column even if the data payload doesn't.
- **Raw-SQL queries that hardcode column names** — NOT protected by the generated client; column renames must be propagated by hand. Known locations as of 2026-05-15:
  - `src/services/capacityService.ts` — `telemetryEligibleSQL` (`cpuMemoryPolling`), `systemInfoEligibleSQL` (`interfacesPolling`).
  - `src/services/capacityAdvisorService.ts:readApplicableCounts` — same two columns.
- **`src/db.ts`** — Prisma client extension; its `Asset.update` / `findMany` / `create` / `updateMany` / `upsert` wrappers go through whatever client is generated. Failure modes here surface as the generic `column "<name>" does not exist` errors in the log.
- **Operators reading the Maintenance tab** — `pg-tuning` and `capacity-advisor` routes consume the raw-SQL readers above; they 500 when those queries fail.

**Invariants:**
- The generated client and the DB schema must agree at every process start. Steps 3-6 are not optional; reordering them re-introduces the failure mode where the running client selects columns the DB no longer has.
- `src/generated/` is gitignored; the build pipeline (postinstall + the updater's explicit step) regenerates it from `schema.prisma`. Never check generated files in.
- A migration that DROPS a column requires every raw-SQL reader of that column to be updated in the same commit. The Prisma client gets rewritten automatically; raw SQL does not.
- A migration that RENAMES a column has the same constraint plus the additional risk that the rename can silently succeed (no DROP) but every reader still queries the old name.
- The updater's `rm -rf dist` between `prisma generate` and `tsc` is load-bearing — stale compiled JS from a previous Prisma-client version can shadow the fresh build.

**When changing this:**
- **Renaming or dropping any DB column:** grep the entire codebase for `prisma.$queryRawUnsafe` and raw-SQL strings containing the column name BEFORE writing the migration. Update those readers in the same commit as the migration.
- **Adding a step to the updater pipeline:** keep the generate → clean-dist → tsc → migrate → restart ordering intact. If the new step needs DB access, decide whether it should run pre- or post-migrate based on what schema state it expects.
- **Changing where the Prisma client is generated to:** update `tsconfig.json` includes, `package.json:postinstall` (if path changes), `.gitignore`, and re-verify `dist/` cleanup still wipes the right path.
- **Recovering a prod box stuck on a stale client:** the recovery procedure is `rm -rf src/generated dist && npx prisma generate && npx tsc && systemctl restart polaris`. Document this in the operator-facing runbook when the failure mode recurs.

**Related:** `cross-cutting/services/updateService.ts` invariants encode the same ordering rules at the pipeline-step level; this section is the broader contract.

## cross-cutting/observability-metrics

**What it is:** The Prometheus `/metrics` surface. One `Registry` singleton in `src/metrics.ts`, one helper per metric (callers never import the metric object directly), CPU/process defaults from `prom-client.collectDefaultMetrics`. Three label-discipline rules: `route` is the matched Express template not the URL; `integrationId` is the only UUID-shaped label allowed; everything else is bounded (cadence, transport, table, queue, state, status_class, severity, mode, status, outcome, job).

**Writers** (files that emit metric values):
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts` — pass timer, work-item timer + outcome, probe duration + outcome, monitored-asset gauge, cursor-mode queue depth gauge, sample-write timer per table (asset_monitor_samples / asset_telemetry_samples / asset_temperature_samples / asset_interface_samples / asset_storage_samples / asset_ipsec_tunnel_samples / asset_associated_ips / asset_lldp_neighbors).
- `src/services/queueService.ts:refreshPgbossMetrics()` — every 15s in pg-boss mode; emits `polaris_pgboss_queue_jobs{queue,state}` (counts) AND `polaris_pgboss_oldest_job_age_seconds{queue,state}` (oldest waiting job's age, MIN(created_on) per queue×state). Also emits `polaris_monitor_queue_mode` once at boot in `initializeQueue()` and `polaris_monitor_workers` from `startPgbossWorkers()`.
- `src/services/fmgWorker.ts` — per-integration queue depth + inflight gauges (one set per integrationId).
- `src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts` — `polaris_monitor_workers` cursor-mode seed at module load; mirrors `setMonitoredAssets` from the pg-boss publisher path so both modes drive the same gauges.
- `src/jobs/capacityWatch.ts` — every 10 min from `getCapacitySnapshot()`: emits `polaris_db_pool_*` (in_use / peak_observed / polaris_capacity / max), `polaris_capacity_severity`, `polaris_disk_free_ratio{volume,roles}`, `polaris_db_dead_tuple_ratio{table}`, `polaris_db_size_bytes`, `polaris_db_steady_state_size_bytes`. Volume + table gauges are `.reset()` before re-stamping each tick so dropped volumes / removed tables don't leave orphan series.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` — discovery duration histogram + outcome counter at all three integration outcomes (success / abort / failure) alongside the existing `recordSample()` call.
- `src/app.ts` — HTTP request timer + in-flight gauge middleware (mounted right after CSRF; skips `/metrics` and `/health`; `/api/v1/auth/login` rate-limited 429s still observed).
- `src/jobs/_metrics.ts:runInstrumentedJob(name, fn)` — every job in `src/jobs/` wraps its tick body with this helper; emits `polaris_job_duration_seconds{job}` + `polaris_job_total{job, outcome}` without changing the job's existing error semantics. `monitorAssets.probe` and `monitorAssets.heavy` are the two label values from the only multi-tick job.

**Readers** (operators / scrapers / out-of-band consumers): `/metrics` HTTP endpoint in `src/app.ts`, gated by `METRICS_TOKEN` Bearer-token auth (auto-generated by the first-run setup wizard). No internal callers — everything Polaris uses comes from in-process state directly.

**Invariants:**
- Single `Registry` singleton — never create a second one. `collectDefaultMetrics` is registered at module load.
- Helpers, not raw metric objects. Callers import `recordProbe(...)` not `probeDuration` so renames or label changes are localized.
- Cardinality is bounded by design. The only non-bounded labels are `integrationId` (counted in dozens) and `route` (counted in route templates, not URLs).
- Cursor-mode-only metrics zero out in pg-boss mode and vice versa — never assume both families are populated. Use `polaris_monitor_queue_mode` to pick which family is authoritative on a given instance.
- `polaris_disk_free_ratio` and `polaris_db_dead_tuple_ratio` are `.reset()` before each capacityWatch re-stamp; volume label set is "current filesystems," not "every filesystem ever seen."
- Sample-write timing is observed only on successful writes. A throw skips the `stop()` call, which is the desired behavior — failures don't pollute the latency distribution.
- Discovery duration histogram observes only on `outcome="success"`; failure/aborted outcomes increment the counter without distorting P95.
- HTTP middleware skips `/metrics` itself so scrape requests aren't counted as application traffic. `/health` skipped for the same reason.

**When changing this:**
- Adding a metric? Define the metric object + its helpers in `src/metrics.ts`, then call from one place. Update the Observability section of CLAUDE.md.
- Adding a job? Wrap the tick body in `runInstrumentedJob("name", async () => ...)` from `src/jobs/_metrics.ts`. Use a stable, machine-readable name (no spaces, no version suffixes); split-loop jobs use `<module>.<loop>` (e.g. `monitorAssets.probe`).
- Adding a label? Audit cardinality first — a per-asset label would explode at fleet scale. If the value is a UUID or per-row, push it into a histogram bucket or aggregate it instead.
- Pg-boss → cursor or vice versa? Both modes' metrics keep emitting; the gauge that doesn't apply stays at 0. Don't conditionally remove either family.
- Changing `getCapacitySnapshot()` shape? Update the `setCapacityGauges` adapter in `capacityWatch.ts` so the gauge stamping doesn't drift from the snapshot fields.
- Changing the HTTP middleware? It must run after session+CSRF (so `req.session` / status are valid) but before the route layer (so `req.route?.path` is captured at finish-time). The current mount point is right after `csrfMiddleware`.

## cross-cutting/csp-inline-script-policy

**What it is:** Helmet's Content-Security-Policy in `src/app.ts` sets `scriptSrc: ["'self'"]` — every `<script>...</script>` block with inline content is BLOCKED by the browser. Only external `<script src="...">` tags and inline `on*=` handler attributes (allowed via `scriptSrcAttr: ["'unsafe-inline'"]`) are permitted. This is the most dangerous XSS vector closed by the strict CSP, and it must stay closed.

**Writers** (anywhere a Polaris route or stub HTML emits inline scripts — must be EMPTY of inline scripts):
- `src/app.ts:405` — `legacyIpamRedirect()` stub HTML. Loads `/js/legacy-ipam-redirect.js` (external file at `public/js/legacy-ipam-redirect.js`) which reads `location.pathname` to decide the target tab and `location.hash` to preserve the legacy fragment, then `location.replace()`s to `/ipam.html#tab=<tab>&<legacyHash>`. Was a `blank page` regression for two weeks (2026-04 to 2026-05) when this used an inline `<script>` block — CSP silently blocked the redirect, leaving a blank body. Symptom for the operator: clicking "View Lease → Open in Networks" on the assets page navigated to `/subnets.html#ip=<sid>@<ip>` and stayed blank.
- Any future server-rendered stub or framework view should use an external file (or pass data via `data-*` attributes that the external script reads via `document.currentScript.dataset`).

**Readers** (the CSP itself):
- `src/app.ts:207-221` — Helmet `contentSecurityPolicy.directives.scriptSrc: ["'self'"]` blocks inline; `scriptSrcAttr: ["'unsafe-inline'"]` keeps `onclick="..."` working because most pages still build HTML via `innerHTML`.

**Invariants:**
- Never emit `<script>...code...</script>` from any HTTP route handler or static file. Always use `<script src="/js/something.js"></script>`. If the inline script needs runtime values from the server, render those as `data-*` attributes on a placeholder element and read them in the external script.
- Adding a CSP hash or nonce for ONE inline script is a slippery slope — it normalizes the pattern. Prefer an external file unless there's a hard reason (e.g. shipping a critical-rendering-path bootstrap that must run before the first paint AND can't be moved to `<head>` async).
- `scriptSrcAttr: 'unsafe-inline'` is the only inline allowance; it's there because `innerHTML`-built `onclick="foo(...)"` is everywhere in the frontend. Don't widen the main `scriptSrc`.
- Browsers fail SILENTLY on CSP block — DevTools console shows the violation but the page renders blank with no JS-thrown error. Always test stub HTML by visiting it in a browser with DevTools open, not just by curling the response and inspecting the body.

**When changing this:**
- Adding a server-rendered HTML stub? Move ALL JS into an external file under `public/js/`. The route handler returns markup with `<script src="..."></script>` only — no inline blocks.
- Need server-side state in client-side code? Render the state into the HTML as `data-*` attributes (`<div id="boot" data-foo="bar">`), then read it from the external script via `document.getElementById("boot").dataset.foo`. Never interpolate JSON into an inline `<script>` block.
- Loosening the CSP for a third-party widget (analytics, support chat, embedded video)? Add the specific origin to `scriptSrc`, not `'unsafe-inline'`. Document the exception in the directive's comment.
- Testing a stub-HTML change? Visit the URL in a browser with DevTools console open — a blocked inline script logs `Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self'"`. A blank body with no JS-thrown error in the source IS the CSP-blocked symptom.
- Adding inline `<style>` tags? Those are allowed via the existing `styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"]`. Only scripts have the strict rule.

# Per-service touches

Listed alphabetically.

## services/activeDirectoryService.ts

**What it owns:** On-prem Active Directory device discovery via LDAP/LDAPS client (computer objects, OU filtering, SID/GUID identity, disabled-account handling).

**Public API:** testConnection, proxyQuery, discoverDevices, ActiveDirectoryConfig, DiscoveredAdDevice, AdDiscoveryResult, AdDiscoveryProgressCallback.

**Cross-service deps:** None (pure LDAP client; no service-to-service calls).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/integrations.ts:14,701,874,1111,1250 — discovery trigger, test connection, manual LDAP proxy query, sync path syncActiveDirectoryDevices.

**Invariants:**
- LDAP simple bind (no Kerberos); default port 636 (LDAPS) or 389 (plain LDAP).
- Device identity: AD `objectGUID` (lowercased hex) → `Asset.assetTag = "ad:{guid}"` (legacy) and `AssetSource.externalId` with `sourceKind="ad"`.
- Cross-link via `objectSid` (string SID) == Entra's `onPremisesSecurityIdentifier` → `tags` stamped with `sid:{SID}` (uppercase) for hybrid-join matching.
- Disabled accounts (userAccountControl & 0x2) → `decommissioned` status when includeDisabled=true (default); skipped entirely when false.
- `ouInclude`/`ouExclude` filters match against full distinguishedName with wildcard support (e.g., `*OU=Workstations*`).
- `lastLogonTimestamp` replicates ~14 days; use as coarse "last seen" signal only.
- Paged subtree search under baseDn with filter `(&(objectCategory=computer)(objectClass=computer))`; hard cap 10,000 results.
- proxyQuery is LDAP search pass-through (filter/baseDn/scope/attributes/sizeLimit configurable).

**When changing this:**
- Verify LDAP bind connection + TLS options (verifyTls flag) still work for LDAPS.
- Test OU filtering (ouInclude/ouExclude wildcard match) against distinguishedName.
- Confirm disabled-account tagging (`ad-disabled` tag) and status logic (decommissioned).
- Check SID cross-link stamping `sid:{SID}` (uppercase) for hybrid-join asset deduplication.
- Validate syncActiveDirectoryDevices creates correct AssetSource rows with sourceKind="ad".
- Test paged search (page size 1000) doesn't miss assets with large OU hierarchies.
- syncActiveDirectoryDevices in integrations.ts runs a forward-DNS pre-pass (via dnsService.getConfiguredResolver) to fill Asset.ipAddress for new + IP-less existing assets. Gate is `!existing.ipAddress` — never overwrites a non-empty IP from FortiGate/Entra/operator. ipSource stamped "activedirectory-dns".

## services/allocationTemplateService.ts

**What it owns:** Named saved multi-subnet allocation templates backed by Setting table.

**Public API:** listTemplates, saveTemplate, deleteTemplate.

**Used by:** src/api/routes/allocationTemplates.ts:10 (all CRUD operations).

**Invariants:**
- Templates stored as JSON blob in Setting.networkAllocationTemplates
- Prefix length must be [8, 32] per entry
- Non-skip entries require a name; skip entries reserve space only
- VLAN, when present, must be [1, 4094]
- Template name uniqueness (case-insensitive) enforced
- anchorPrefix optional, defaults to 24 if omitted when used

**When changing this:**
- Verify saveTemplate's name-collision detection (idempotent update vs new insert)
- Check prefix length validation matches subnetService expectations
- Test that VLAN validation in allocationTemplateService is consistent with route schema

## services/mapRegionService.ts

**What it owns:** Operator-drawn map regions (polygons on the Device Map). CRUD on Setting JSON blob keyed `mapRegions`. Tag-mutation primitives that add `region:<name>` to in-polygon firewalls + cascaded FortiSwitches/FortiAPs and strip it on rename/delete. Tag-registry mirroring (upserts a `Tag` row at `region:<name>` under category "Map Regions" so the asset edit modal's tag picker shows it).

**Public API:** MapRegion, SaveRegionInput, ReconcileSummary, listRegions, getRegion, createRegion, updateRegion, deleteRegion, applyRename, applyDelete, applyOneRegion, reconcileMapRegions.

**Cross-service deps:** `src/utils/geo.ts:pointInPolygon`, `prisma.tag` (registry mirror), `prisma.asset` (membership compute + tag mutations).

**Used by:**
- `src/api/routes/mapRegions.ts` — all CRUD endpoints (`GET / POST / PUT / DELETE /map/regions`); each call awaits the appropriate apply* helper before responding.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` Phase 13 — end-of-syncDhcpSubnets (`mode in {"full", "finalize"}`) calls `reconcileMapRegions()` so newly-discovered firewalls' coords land in the right regions.
- `src/jobs/reconcileMapRegions.ts` — 6h periodic safety net.

**Invariants:**
- Region name unique case-insensitively, 1..64 chars, no control characters.
- Polygon ≥3 vertices and ≤1000; lat in [-90,90]; lng in [-180,180]; finite numbers only.
- Reconciler is **add-only**: only the rename + delete CRUD paths strip a region tag. Manual operator attachments to out-of-polygon assets persist across runs.
- Manually removing a region tag from an in-polygon asset will be re-added on the next reconcile (polygon membership is authoritative in the additive direction).
- Tag-registry rows under category "Map Regions" stay in 1:1 correspondence with region names (create upserts; rename rotates; delete removes).

**When changing this:**
- If the tag prefix or category constants change, also update CLAUDE.md "Map Regions" section + the assets edit modal's tag picker label conventions.
- Membership logic depends on `Asset.fortinetTopology.controllerFortigate` matching firewall hostnames; if discovery ever stops setting that field, the cascade silently breaks. Add a coverage test if discovery topology shape evolves.
- Polygon antimeridian crossings are documented out-of-scope; if Polaris ever supports global polygons, audit `pointInPolygon` for that case.

---

## services/firewallTagService.ts

**What it owns:** `firewall:<hostname>` breadcrumb tags on FortiGate-discovered assets. Reconciler that rebuilds each in-scope asset's `firewall:*` tag set from `Asset.fortinetTopology.controllerFortigate` (managed switches / APs) plus `AssetFortigateSighting` rows within `quarantine.sightingMaxAgeDays` (DHCP-discovered endpoints). Inline lifecycle helpers for firewall create / rename / decommission. Tag-registry mirroring under category "FortiGate".

**Public API:** ReconcileSummary, reconcileFirewallTagsForIntegration, applyFirewallRename, applyFirewallDecommission, seedFirewallTagRegistry.

**Cross-service deps:** `src/services/assetSightingService.ts:getSightingSettings` (reads `sightingMaxAgeDays` for the endpoint freshness window), `prisma.tag` (registry mirror), `prisma.asset` (tag mutations), `prisma.assetFortigateSighting` (endpoint membership).

**Used by:**
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` Phase 2a — calls `applyFirewallDecommission(hostname)` per stale firewall after the status flip.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` Phase 3 firewall create — calls `seedFirewallTagRegistry(fgHostname)` after the `prisma.asset.create` so the picker carries the tag from day one.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` Phase 3 firewall update — calls `applyFirewallRename(old, new)` when projection writes a different hostname.
- `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` Phase 13.5 — calls `reconcileFirewallTagsForIntegration(integrationId)` after the Phase 13 map-region pass (`mode in {"full", "finalize"}`).

**Invariants:**
- The `firewall:` prefix is owned by THIS service. No other writer touches `firewall:*` tags.
- FortiGate firewall assets themselves are never tagged — don't tag a device with itself.
- Strip allowlist is always scoped to the current integration's known firewall hostnames. Tags pointing at FortiGates owned by another integration (or operator-typed `firewall:fake`) survive every reconcile pass.
- Endpoint membership comes from `AssetFortigateSighting` rows whose `integrationId` matches AND whose `lastSeen` is within `sightingMaxAgeDays` (0 = forever).
- Infra membership comes from `Asset.fortinetTopology.controllerFortigate` matching one of this integration's firewall hostnames; switches/APs whose controller field is empty get no firewall tag.
- Reconciler is idempotent: writes only when the tag array actually differs.
- Registry rows under category "FortiGate" stay in 1:1 correspondence with active firewall hostnames (create upserts; rename rotates; decommission removes; the reconciler also re-upserts as a safety net so rows don't go missing).

**When changing this:**
- If the tag prefix or category constants change, also update CLAUDE.md "Firewall tag reconcile (Phase 13.5)" section + the touches.md "Asset.tags" cross-cutting entry.
- Endpoint membership depends on the sightings table's `integrationId` index — if `AssetFortigateSighting`'s indexing changes, audit the `findMany` filter for performance regressions.
- Adding a fourth lifecycle path (e.g. operator-driven hostname rename via PUT /assets/:id on a firewall row) means hooking `applyFirewallRename` in that path too — the projection-driven Phase 3 hook only catches discovery-driven renames.
- The reconciler currently runs only at Phase 13.5 of FMG/FortiGate discovery. If discovery is ever skipped or disabled long-term, stale tags persist — operators should run a manual reconcile or delete the tag manually. (No periodic safety-net job exists by design — every input is discovery-written.)

---

## services/apiTokenService.ts

**What it owns:** Long-lived bearer-token CRUD for external API access; argon2id hash + tokenPrefix-based lookup; scope validation (assets:quarantine, assets:read); integrationIds enforcement for quarantine scope.

**Public API:** KNOWN_SCOPES, ApiTokenScope, ApiTokenSummary, AuthenticatedToken, CreateTokenInput, CreateTokenResult, createToken, listTokens, revokeToken, deleteToken, verifyToken.

**Cross-service deps:** none.

**Used by:**
- src/api/routes/apiTokens.ts:55 — GET /api-tokens, list all tokens
- src/api/routes/apiTokens.ts:71 — POST /api-tokens, create new token (show raw once)
- src/api/routes/apiTokens.ts:96 — POST /api-tokens/:id/revoke, revoke by ID
- src/api/routes/apiTokens.ts:114 — DELETE /api-tokens/:id, delete by ID
- src/api/middleware/auth.ts:89 — attachApiToken middleware, verify bearer token on every request
- ...and N other call sites (quarantine/release endpoints use verifyToken indirectly via middleware)

**Invariants:**
- Wire format: `Authorization: Bearer polaris_<32-char-base64url-tail>` (prefix stored separately for fast candidate lookup via index).
- tokenHash is argon2id; never returned; rawToken shown ONCE at creation (POST response).
- assets:quarantine scope requires integrationIds (≥1 FortiManager/FortiGate id); assets:read scopes may have empty integrationIds.
- verifyToken() is best-effort on lastUsedAt/lastUsedIp updates; missed bumps don't fail auth.
- Expired tokens (expiresAt in past) and revoked tokens (revokedAt set) are silently excluded from lookup; no 401 distinction.

**When changing this:**
- Audit scope validation (validateIntegrationIds) if adding new integration types to quarantine support.
- Test wire format edge cases (malformed prefix, truncated token, null bearer header).
- Verify tokenPrefix index is used in verifyToken candidate fetch to keep lookup O(indexed).
- Check that expiresAt comparison handles null and timezone offsets correctly.
- Review quarantine endpoints (assets routes) to confirm they call attachApiToken middleware before verifyToken.

---

## services/assetIpHistoryService.ts

**What it owns:** Asset IP history reads, Settings-backed retention policy, pruning sweep (auto-populated by Prisma query extension in `src/db.ts`).

**Public API:** `getIpHistory(), pruneOldHistory(), getHistorySettings(), updateHistorySettings()`

**Cross-service deps:** None.

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/assets.ts:522 — fetch IP history for asset detail modal`, `src/api/routes/assets.ts:343 — prune endpoint (manual trigger)`

**Invariants:**
- History is auto-populated on every Asset write that touches `ipAddress`; this service reads + prunes only.
- Retention is Setting-backed (`retentionDays`, default 0 = keep forever); `getIpHistory()` filters on read, stored rows never auto-delete unless `pruneOldHistory()` is called.
- `pruneOldHistory()` is a manual operation (not yet hooked to a background job); operator triggers via Server Settings → Maintenance → Prune old IP history.
- Setting persists across app restarts; read-time filtering is applied client-side by `getIpHistory()` calls.

**When changing this:**
- If adding background prune job (jobs/pruneIpHistory.ts), ensure it respects the Setting key "assetIpHistorySettings".
- Verify Prisma extension in `src/db.ts` still writes `AssetIpHistory` on Asset.ipAddress changes.
- Check assets.html History tab UI for retentionDays Setting control + prune button.
- Ensure Prisma schema AssetIpHistory._unique_ constraint on (assetId, ip) handles re-sight updates (lastSeen bump).

---

## services/assetQuarantineService.ts

**What it owns:** Push/pull FortiGate MAC quarantine via persistent `user.quarantine.targets` CMDB tree; orchestrates multi-FortiGate best-effort with per-device all-or-nothing atomicity.

**Public API:** `quarantineAsset(), releaseQuarantine(), verifyAssetQuarantine(), buildTransportForIntegration(), pushQuarantineToFortigate(), unpushQuarantineFromFortigate(), normalizeMac(), quarantineTargetName()`

**Cross-service deps:** `assetSightingService.ts` (for candidate targeting).

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/assets.ts:2098,2115,2130,2168,2189 — quarantine/release/verify endpoints (4 routes)`, `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:3182,3185 — auto-quarantine post-discovery on new FortiGate sighting`

**Invariants:**
- Infrastructure assets (firewall/switch/access_point) rejected at `quarantineAsset()` entry; release does NOT enforce type guard (operator can orphan old entries).
- Per-FortiGate is all-or-nothing (partial failures roll back); across-FortiGate is best-effort (failed targets recorded as `status: "failed"` in `quarantineTargets[]`).
- `statusBeforeQuarantine` preserved on quarantine → release restores it (null → "active" fallback).
- Standalone FortiGate + FMG (proxy/direct) both supported via `buildTransportForIntegration()` parity.
- `quarantineTargets` JSON tracks per-target status: `"synced"` (verified), `"drift"` (missing on later verify), `"failed"` (push error); only `"synced"` eligible for drift-flip on verify.
- Token-scoped quarantine (bearer token) filters sightings by integration before push; release refuses outright if quarantine touches out-of-scope integrations (no partial release).

**When changing this:**
- Audit `fortigateService.ts` + `fortimanagerService.ts` transport compatibility if FortiOS version bumps or endpoint changes.
- Check infrastructure-asset type list (firewall/switch/access_point) against Asset.assetType enum + discovery source-kind tagging.
- Verify `getSightingSettings()` Settings key and max-age filter alignment with caller expectations.
- Review rollback/error-logging in event payload (event action names: asset.quarantine.succeeded/partial/failed/released/unpush.failed).

---

## services/assetSightingService.ts

**What it owns:** Records DHCP-only (asset, FortiGate) sightings to drive quarantine fan-out targeting.

**Public API:** `recordSightings(), getSightingsForAsset(), getQuarantineCandidates(), getSightingSettings(), updateSightingSettings()`

**Cross-service deps:** None.

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:3148 — batch-record sightings after DHCP discovery sync`, `src/api/routes/assets.ts:1837 — fetch sighting list for Quarantine tab`, `src/services/assetQuarantineService.ts:455 — fan-out targeting within quarantineAsset()`

**Invariants:**
- Sightings are deduped by `(assetId, fortigateDevice)` pair; `seenAt` determines entry precedence, `dhcp_reservation` trumps `dhcp_lease` on tie.
- `getQuarantineCandidates()` filters by `sightingMaxAgeDays` Setting (default 180; 0 = no filter); stored rows never auto-prune.
- Only DHCP evidence qualifies (transit via System tab interface scrape intentionally excluded per design).
- Every caller of `recordSightings()` must dedupe + normalize before passing; batch upsert handles dedup again for safety.

**When changing this:**
- Check `assetQuarantineService.ts` `quarantineAsset()` for sighting-filter logic (max-age, integration scoping).
- Verify `integrations.ts` `syncDhcpSubnets()` call site still matches expected SightingInput shape.
- Review Settings UI (assets.html) sighting age control and max-age tooltip.
- Ensure `pruneOldHistory` job (if added) respects Setting-backed retention separately from max-age filter.

---

## services/autoMonitorInterfacesService.ts

**What it owns:** Auto-monitor interface selection UI for FMG/FortiGate integration (three resolver modes: names / wildcard / type). Selection is additive only—never strips existing operator-owned pins.

**Public API:** `compileWildcard`, `resolvePinnedInterfaces`, `getInterfaceAggregate`, `previewAutoMonitorForClass`, `applyAutoMonitorForClass`, `AutoMonitorSelection`, `AutoMonitorClass`, `ResolverInterface`, `AggregateRow`, `PreviewResult`, `ApplyResult`.

**Cross-service deps:** none.

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:25` — apply auto-monitor on discovery and per-class config change (lines 961, 2197).

**Invariants:**
- **Additive-only contract:** `applyAutoMonitorForClass()` union-merges resolved pins with existing `Asset.monitoredInterfaces`; never deletes pins. Operator hand-pins persist across discovery cycles even if auto-config would exclude them.
- **Three resolver modes:** names (exact match set); wildcard (shell `*`/`?` patterns compiled to regex with escaping); type (ifType set matching + optional `onlyUp` filter on operStatus).
- **Latest interface resolution:** `loadLatestInterfaces()` uses `DISTINCT ON (assetId, ifName)` ORDER BY timestamp DESC to get most-recent sample per interface; no separate inventory table.

**When changing this:**
- If adding resolver modes, ensure `resolvePinnedInterfaces()` remains pure (no DB, no I/O) and `applyAutoMonitorForClass()` still verifies additive contract before writing.
- Test wildcard escaping: special chars like `[`, `]`, `^`, `$`, `.` must not become regex syntax.
- Verify aggregation queries stay efficient: `DISTINCT ON` over many assets/interfaces can be slow if interface sample table is huge; consider pagination/filtering if discovering thousands of assets.

---

## services/azureAuthService.ts

**What it owns:** Azure AD (Entra) SAML 2.0 SSO configuration, relay-state generation, SAML response validation, user provisioning on first login.

**Public API:** getSsoSettings, updateSsoSettings, isAzureSsoConfigured, isAzureSsoConfiguredAsync, generateRelayState, getSamlLoginUrl, validateSamlResponse, getSamlLogoutUrl, findOrProvisionSamlUser, SsoSettings.

**Cross-service deps:** None (SAML + database; no service-to-service calls).

**Used by:** src/app.ts:25 — check SSO configured on startup to conditionally skip login page, src/api/routes/auth.ts:29 — SAML login/logout flow (generateRelayState, getSamlLoginUrl, validateSamlResponse, getSamlLogoutUrl, findOrProvisionSamlUser).

**Invariants:**
- SSO settings stored in Setting table (key="sso"); 30-second in-memory cache with expiry.
- SAML IdP config (Entity ID, Login/Logout URLs, certificate) configured via Users page Settings modal.
- Relay state generated as random 32-byte base64url for CSRF protection on redirect.
- SAML response validation uses @node-saml/node-saml library; wantResponseSigned flag controls signature check.
- User provisioning on first login: extract nameID/email from validated Profile, upsert User row with default role, auto-enable if disabled.
- skipLoginPage flag allows direct IdP redirect when SSO enabled (bypass Polaris login page).
- autoLogoutMinutes triggers silent logout after inactivity (0 = disabled).

**When changing this:**
- Test SSO cache expiry (30s) on getSsoSettings; verify updateSsoSettings invalidates _samlClient.
- Check SAML validation still rejects unsigned responses when wantResponseSigned=true.
- Confirm user provisioning correctly maps SAML Profile fields (nameID, email, groups) to User rows.
- Validate skipLoginPage redirect flow doesn't expose relay state leaks.
- Test logout URL generation with correct nameID/sessionIndex from validated response.

---

## services/blockService.ts

**What it owns:** IP block CRUD and metadata (name, tags, description).

**Public API:** listBlocks, getBlock, createBlock, updateBlock, deleteBlock.

**Used by:** src/api/routes/blocks.ts:7 (all CRUD operations), src/services/subnetService.ts (block parent lookups, overlap validation).

**Invariants:**
- Block deletion forbidden if any active reservations exist across child subnets
- CIDR must be normalized and unique
- IP version immutable after creation (v4 vs v6)
- Tags are optional arrays, filtered client-side in listBlocks

**When changing this:**
- Verify deleteBlock's active-reservation cascade check (affects data integrity)
- Test CIDR normalization in createBlock (e.g., 10.1.1.5/24 → 10.1.1.0/24)
- Check block-listing performance if tag filtering is optimized

---

## services/capacityService.ts

**What it owns:** Capacity snapshot (host/DB/workload), severity grading (ok/watch/amber/red), reason codes, Event emission on severity transition, and steady-state DB size projection. Also orchestrates the two-pass `getCapacitySnapshotWithAdvisor` helper that interleaves Capacity Advisor recompute with reason-building.

**Public API:** `getCapacitySnapshot`, `getCapacitySnapshotWithAdvisor`, `recordCapacityTransition`.

**Cross-service deps:** `monitoringService` (cadences, retention), `timescaleService` (hypertable check), `queueService` (pg-boss installed, boot/persisted mode), `deploymentContext` (DB co-location), `capacityAdvisorService` (dynamic import in `getCapacitySnapshotWithAdvisor`; type-only the other direction to avoid runtime cycle).

**Used by:** `src/jobs/capacityWatch.ts — 10-min capacity check + Event emission`; `src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts — /pg-tuning, /capacity-advisor, /capacity-advisor/stage endpoints`. ~6 call sites.

**Invariants:**
- Severity tiers: **red** = disk <10%, DB >50% of free disk, stale autovacuum >7d on sample table (Timescale hypertables exempt — append-only chunks legitimately don't autovacuum), projected >8× RAM; **amber** = disk 10–20%, projected >4× RAM, dead-tup >20%, ram_insufficient (recommendedRamGb > 0 — fires when totalmem() < 2× DB size, displays target GB in suggestion), pgTuningNeeded, max_connections_undersized (advisor-driven); **watch** = disk 20–30%, db_pool_undersized (>=80% of pool capacity), monitor_workers_undersized (advisor-driven rollup), monitor_handler_timeout_pressure (advisor-driven; p90 ≥ 70% of `pgboss.queue.expire_seconds` on any monitor cadence), timescale_recommended (sample tables >1 GB, extension not installed), metrics_token_unset, health_token_unset; **ok** = none.
- Legacy `pgboss_recommended` / `pgboss_overdue` / `pgboss_pending` reasons were absorbed into the Capacity Advisor's QUEUE_MODE lever and no longer fire. The advisor's per-lever recommendations are the source of truth for queue-mode advice.
- Advisor-driven reasons (`monitor_workers_undersized`, `max_connections_undersized`, `monitor_handler_timeout_pressure`) only fire when callers pass `advisor` gap data into `computeReasons`. `getCapacitySnapshot` with `advisor: undefined` skips them; `getCapacitySnapshotWithAdvisor` builds the gaps and re-runs the snapshot in pass 2. `monitor_handler_timeout_pressure` carries per-cadence pressure entries lifted from `AdvisorState.handlerTimeoutPressure`, which the advisor populates by reading live `pgboss.queue.expire_seconds` values and comparing to observed histogram p90.
- Reason codes are unique per condition — `projected_exceeds_disk` (red) and `projected_approaches_disk` (amber, >75%) compare *additional growth needed* (`max(0, steadyState - currentDbSize)`) against free disk on the DB volume, not the steady-state total — the bytes already on disk are part of the steady-state total but aren't future growth, so double-counting them was firing red prematurely. Codes are deliberately distinct so transition Events stay distinguishable.
- Volumes deduped by `stat.dev` so single-LV box = one entry, STIG RHEL with separate /var = two.
- Steady-state projection = base DB size – current sample table bytes + projected sample bytes (per monitored asset × rows/day/asset × retention × bytes/row).
- Sample table rows-per-asset-per-day: conservative defaults (e.g., asset_monitor_samples = 86400/intervalSeconds) when no samples yet.
- Connection-pool peak tracking: rolling high-water across all snapshots (resets on process restart); captured before snapshot read so it reflects current state.
- Transition logic: compare new severity to stored severity; emit Event only on change; Severity → Event level: red→error, amber/watch→warning, ok→info.
- recordCapacityTransition() is best-effort (errors logged at debug, never thrown).

**When changing this:**
- Test volume dedup on multi-LV layouts (separate /var/lib/pgsql and /app).
- Verify steady-state projection doesn't underestimate (conservative DEFAULT_ROWS_PER_ASSET_PER_DAY is key).
- Check connection-pool peak doesn't reset unexpectedly (module-local state should survive across route calls).
- Confirm Event emission only fires once per severity change (no duplicate "red" events on each tick).
- Test fallback PG data directory candidates on RHEL/Windows when `SHOW data_directory` fails (non-superuser app role).

---

## services/connectionPathService.ts

**What it owns:** `resolveConnectionPath(assetId)` — endpoint → switch → … → FortiGate connection-path resolver. Walks the upward dependency chain so the Device Map topology overlay can dim everything off-path.

**Public API:** `resolveConnectionPath`, plus the `ConnectionPath` / `ConnectionPathHop` / `ConnectionHopKind` types.

**Cross-service deps:** Reads `Asset` rows directly + `AssetDependencyParent` (the same source-of-truth `dependencyTreeService` writes). Falls back to `Asset.fortinetTopology` when the dependency tree is empty.

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/assets.ts — GET /api/v1/assets/:id/connection-path`. Total 1 call site today.

**Invariants:**
- Firewall start short-circuits: `hops = [self]`, `siteId = self.id`, `alternateUplinks = 0`.
- Switch / AP start: walk begins at self.
- Endpoint start (workstation / server / printer / other): parse `Asset.lastSeenSwitch = "<switchId>/<port>"`; resolve the switch by hostname OR serialNumber under `assetType="switch"`.
- Upward walk reads `AssetDependencyParent` rows; `source="override"` set takes precedence over `source="computed"` per the existing dependency convention. Empty override set is NOT modeled here — the resolver just sees zero parents and falls through to fortinetTopology.
- MCLAG / dual-homed parents pick the one with `monitorStatus="up"` AND most-recent `lastMonitorAt`; remaining parent count is summed across hops into `alternateUplinks`.
- Fallback to `fortinetTopology.controllerFortigate` (switch → firewall) and `.parentSwitch` (AP → switch) only when `AssetDependencyParent` returns zero rows for the cursor — covers fresh installs before `backfillDependencyTree` runs and freshly-discovered switches awaiting recompute.
- Cycle / pathological-data guard: walk cap of 16 hops + a `seen` set so a self-referential override row can't infinite-loop the resolver.
- `endpointPort` lives only on the first switch hop after an endpoint (parsed from `lastSeenSwitch`); `uplinkInterface` lives on every switch / AP hop (from `fortinetTopology.uplinkInterface`).

**When changing this:**
- If MCLAG parent-preference rules change, update both the sort and the `alternateUplinks` accumulation in lock-step.
- If `lastSeenSwitch` format ever shifts beyond `"<switchId>/<port>"`, update `parseLastSeenSwitch`. Discovery writes both `hostname` and `serialNumber` forms today; both are matched by `findSwitchByName`.
- Keep the fortinetTopology fallback rules aligned with how FMG / FortiGate discovery stamps these fields — see fortimanagerService.ts FortiSwitch / FortiAP write paths.
- Don't include `dependencyLayer` in hops — the resolver runs even when the layer is null (e.g. fresh switches between recomputes), and the consumer doesn't need it.
- AssetDependencyParent does NOT contain endpoint rows by design (the dependency tree is infra-scoped); changing that would require coordinating with `dependencyTreeService.recomputeDependencyTree`.

## services/credentialService.ts

**What it owns:** Named-credential store for monitoring probes (SNMP v2c/v3, WinRM, SSH, REST API); type-specific config validation; secret masking on GET; merge-and-preserve logic for PUT to retain secrets when client resubmits mask.

**Public API:** CredentialType, SnmpV2cConfig, SnmpV3Config, SnmpConfig, WinRmConfig, SshConfig, RestApiConfig, CredentialConfig, CredentialRecord, SaveCredentialInput, UpdateCredentialInput, stripSecrets, validateConfig, mergeConfigPreservingSecrets, listCredentials, getCredential, createCredential, updateCredential, deleteCredential.

**Cross-service deps:** none.

**Used by:**
- src/api/routes/credentials.ts:50 — GET /credentials, list (secrets masked)
- src/api/routes/credentials.ts:57 — GET /credentials/:id, fetch one
- src/api/routes/credentials.ts:65 — POST /credentials, create
- src/api/routes/credentials.ts:87 — PUT /credentials/:id, update (merge w/ secret preservation)
- src/api/routes/credentials.ts:174 — DELETE /credentials/:id, revoke (fails 409 if asset references it)
- src/api/routes/assets.ts:30 — GET /assets/:id/resolve-monitor-setting, fetch credential for asset monitoring setup

**Invariants:**
- Secret fields (community, authKey, privKey, password, privateKey, apiToken) are masked to "••••••••" on every GET; empty string and mask are treated as "preserve from stored value" on PUT.
- SNMP v2c requires community; v3 requires username + security level + auth/priv keys per level.
- SSH requires username + (password OR privateKey); WinRM requires both username + password.
- REST API requires baseUrl (http/https only, no trailing slash stored) + apiToken; verifyTls defaults false.
- Delete fails with 409 if any asset.monitorCredentialId points to it; check all six Asset credential type columns (monitorCredentialId, responseTimeCredentialId, cpuMemoryCredentialId, temperatureCredentialId, interfacesCredentialId, lldpCredentialId). MonitorClassOverride also has five per-stream credential FK columns (responseTimeCredentialId / cpuMemoryCredentialId / temperatureCredentialId / interfacesCredentialId / lldpCredentialId) with ON DELETE SET NULL — Postgres nulls those automatically, no application 409 needed.
- validateConfig is called on CREATE and on PUT (after merge), catching type/field mismatches early.

**When changing this:**
- Test secret masking round-trip (GET → masked, PUT w/ mask → original preserved).
- Add new credential types: extend CredentialType union, add SECRET_FIELDS_BY_TYPE entry, add validateXxxConfig branch.
- Test all SNMP v3 security-level combos (noAuthNoPriv, authNoPriv, authPriv); validate protocol enums.
- Ensure delete check covers all five asset credential columns; update the test suite when columns change.
- Verify REST API baseUrl normalization (trim, remove trailing slash, require http/https scheme).

## services/deviceIconService.ts

**What it owns:** Operator-uploaded device icons (PNG/JPEG/WebP/SVG; 256KB cap raster, 32KB cap SVG; magic-byte check for raster, pattern-reject validation for SVG); bytes-in-DB storage. Every icon is keyed to (manufacturer, type-or-model); resolution priority is `manufacturer-model: <mfr>/<model>` → `manufacturer-type: <mfr>/<assetType>`. Manufacturer values canonicalized through `manufacturerAlias` map at both upload and resolution time.

**Public API:** `uploadIcon(), listIcons(), getIconImage(), deleteIcon(), resolveIconForAsset(), loadIconResolutionCache(), resolveIconUrl(), validateUpload()`

**Cross-service deps:** `utils/manufacturerNormalize.normalizeManufacturer()` for alias-canonicalization of manufacturer values (both the standalone manufacturer scope and the manufacturer half of model:<mfr>/<model> keys).

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/deviceIcons.ts:32,56,83,105 — upload/list/delete CRUD + image serve`, `src/api/routes/map.ts:210,267,369,588,710,787 — icon resolution for topology switches/APs/firewalls (icon cache preloaded once per request)`

**Invariants:**
- Scope: "manufacturer-type" (asset type key, enum: server/switch/router/firewall/workstation/printer/access_point/other) or "manufacturer-model" (vendor-specific chassis/model). Both require a manufacturer; standalone type/model/manufacturer uploads are not supported.
- Canonical key form: `"<canonicalManufacturer>/<typeOrModel>"`. Manufacturer half always runs through normalizeManufacturer (alias map). Type tail lowercased; model tail preserved as typed.
- Upload validation: mimeType must be PNG/JPEG/WebP/SVG; raster size ≤256KB, SVG size ≤32KB; raster requires magic-byte prefix matching declared mimeType; SVG is reject-on-pattern (refused if it contains <script>, <foreignObject>, <iframe>, <object>, <embed>, <!DOCTYPE>, <!ENTITY>, <?xml-stylesheet>, on*= event handlers, javascript: URLs, any non-#fragment href/xlink:href/src, @import, or external url()).
- Resolution is most-specific-wins: manufacturer-model → manufacturer-type → null (frontend leaves node as a plain status circle). Assets with no manufacturer resolve to null directly — no fallback to "any vendor".
- `resolveIconUrl()` is synchronous (used in hot topology path); operates against pre-loaded cache from `loadIconResolutionCache()`. Both call sites share `buildResolutionCandidates()` so the priority order can't drift between sync and async paths.
- Topology renderer overlays the icon at 68% of the node size centered (not full-bleed) so the node's role-colored background ring stays visible around the logo. See `public/js/topology-render.js` `node[hasIcon=1]` style.
- Bytes stored as Uint8Array in DeviceIcon.data column; `/api/v1/device-icons/:id/image` serves raw bytes with Content-Type + Cache-Control. SVG responses additionally carry X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff and a strict CSP (`default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src data:; sandbox`) as defense-in-depth against validator bypass.

**When changing this:**
- Check magic-byte prefixes (PNG/JPEG/WebP) if adding new raster formats; ensure length matches actual file signatures.
- SVG_REJECT_PATTERNS is the security boundary — adding a new tag/attribute reject pattern is fine, but loosening one needs careful review (every entry maps to a known XSS / XXE / SSRF vector).
- Sync VALID_TYPE_KEYS set against Asset.assetType enum if new types added.
- Verify Prisma DeviceIcon schema: unique constraint on (scope, key), Bytes column type for data. Scope is a String column — no DB migration needed when adding new scope values.
- Review map.ts topology rendering (resolveIconUrl call sites) if icon resolution priority changes — but priority is built once in `buildResolutionCandidates()`, so updates land in both sync and async paths together.
- Ensure upload route multer fileSize limit (256KB) stays at or above the raster MAX_ICON_BYTES constant. SVG's tighter MAX_SVG_BYTES is enforced inside validateUpload after multer accepts.
- Image-serve route: any new mimeType added to ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES that could execute (script-bearing text formats) needs the same CSP/nosniff treatment as SVG.
- Topology renderer style for `node[hasIcon=1]` in `public/js/topology-render.js` deliberately does NOT override `background-color` so the role-colored status ring shows around the inset logo. If you make the icon full-bleed again, also restore the explicit white background fallback.

## services/discoveryDurationService.ts

**What it owns:** Rolling discovery-duration tracking per integration (and per-FortiGate within FMG runs), baseline computation for slow-run detection, and threshold formula.

**Public API:** `recordSample`, `getBaseline`, `getBaselines`, `computeBaseline`.

**Cross-service deps:** none (reads/writes Settings key "discoveryDurationStats").

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:1035 — slow-check baseline lookup`; `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:1212,1310 — record per-FG and overall run durations`. ~3 call sites.

**Invariants:**
- Only successful (non-aborted, non-errored) runs recorded; failed runs skip `recordSample()` to avoid poisoning the average.
- Rolling window = 10 samples; new sample appends, list trims to last 10.
- Baseline requires ≥3 samples; returns null otherwise.
- Slow-run threshold = `max(avg + 2σ, avg × 1.5, avg + 60s)` — ensures headroom even on uniform fast runs.
- Unit key is either integrationId (overall) or `${integrationId}:${fortigateDevice}` (per-FG).
- Stats are stored in Settings as `{ units: { [unitKey]: { samples: [ms], updatedAt } } }`.

**When changing this:**
- Test threshold formula on small sample sets (3–5 entries) to ensure floor (60s) prevents false positives.
- Verify window=10 balances responsiveness vs stability; too small (5) may be jittery, too large (20) may lag env changes.
- Check getBaselines() batch reads are correct (no off-by-one in map population).
- Confirm recordSample() ignores invalid input (negative ms, non-finite values).
- Test edge case: if all 10 samples are identical, stddev=0 and threshold should still be avg + 60s (floor wins).

## services/dnsService.ts

**What it owns:** Reverse (IP → PTR) and forward (hostname → A/AAAA) DNS lookup via three modes (standard/UDP, DoT/TLS, DoH/HTTPS); per-asset TTL caching; resolver configuration storage.

**Public API:** DnsSettings, PtrRecord, ARecord, ResolverLike, getDnsSettings, updateDnsSettings, createResolver, getConfiguredResolver.

**Used by:**
- src/api/routes/assets.ts:14 — GET /assets/:id, resolve PTR names for associated IPs
- src/api/routes/integrations.ts:20 — POST /integrations/discover, resolve PTR during discovery
- src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts:34 — GET/PUT /server-settings/dns, CRUD DNS config + test endpoint

**Invariants:**
- Three modes (standard, dot, doh): standard falls back to system DNS, returns null TTL; DoT connects to port 853 (configurable), parses TCP wire format; DoH uses JSON API (Cloudflare/Google/Quad9).
- Standard mode cannot retrieve TTL from Node's DNS API; callers apply a sensible default (3600s).
- Per-asset PTR caching lives on AssetAssociatedIp.ptrName/ptrTtl/ptrFetchedAt (separate call path for bulk DNS job).
- IPv6 PTR queries use fully-expanded form with nibble reversal (e.g., 2001:db8::1 → 1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa).
- DoH and DoT timeouts are 5 seconds; DoH rejectUnauthorized=false for self-signed certs.
- Standard mode resolver is constructed with `{ timeout: 5000, tries: 1 }` to keep one unresponsive upstream from compounding into ~20s of per-host wall-clock (c-ares defaults to 4 tries) — critical for the AD forward-DNS pre-pass which can fan out hundreds of names.

**When changing this:**
- Test all three modes end-to-end; verify TTL handling (null for standard, numeric for DoT/DoH).
- Test IPv6 expansion and nibble reversal separately.
- Verify DoT socket cleanup on timeout (don't leak TLS connections).
- Check DoH JSON parse for missing/malformed responses; filter by type number (1=A, 28=AAAA, 12=PTR).

## services/entraIdService.ts

**What it owns:** Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) + Intune device discovery via OAuth2 Graph API client (device registration, Intune enrollment, compliance, user assignment).

**Public API:** testConnection, proxyQuery, discoverDevices, EntraIdConfig, DiscoveredEntraDevice, EntraDiscoveryResult, EntraDiscoveryProgressCallback.

**Cross-service deps:** None (pure Graph API client; no service-to-service calls).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/integrations.ts:13,699,861,1110,1241 — discovery trigger, test connection, manual Graph proxy query, sync path syncEntraDevices.

**Invariants:**
- OAuth2 client-credentials flow; tokens cached in-memory by tenantId:clientId until expiry ≥60s buffer.
- Device identity: Entra `deviceId` (GUID) is stable key → `AssetSource.externalId` with `sourceKind="entra"` or `"intune"`.
- When enableIntune=true, both `/v1.0/devices` and `/v1.0/deviceManagement/managedDevices` are fetched & merged on azureADDeviceId ↔ deviceId; Intune data wins on shared fields.
- Hybrid-joined devices carry `onPremisesSecurityIdentifier` (SID) → cross-link to activeDirectoryService via `sid:{SID}` tags.
- Disabled devices (accountEnabled=false) → `decommissioned` status when `includeDisabled=true` (default).
- Asset type inferred from Intune `chassisType` (desktop/laptop → workstation; other → other); Entra-only defaults to workstation.
- `deviceInclude`/`deviceExclude` filters match against displayName with wildcard support.
- proxyQuery is read-only Graph API pass-through (GET only, /v1.0/ or /beta/ prefix required).

**When changing this:**
- Test OAuth2 token caching + refresh 60s before expiry; verify no mid-request expirations.
- Verify Intune merge logic on shared fields (Intune data must win over Entra).
- Check hybrid-join SID cross-link still tags assets correctly for AD ↔ Entra matching.
- Validate deviceInclude/deviceExclude wildcard matching against displayName.
- Confirm syncEntraDevices in integrations.ts creates AssetSource rows with correct sourceKind ("entra"/"intune") based on sources array.

---

## services/eventArchiveService.ts

**What it owns:** All outbound Event flows (syslog/SFTP archival), event retention/prune configuration, and asset auto-decommission settings. Events created anywhere flow through here via job (pruneEvents) + optional real-time forwarders.

**Public API:** `getArchiveSettings`, `updateArchiveSettings`, `testConnection`, `archiveAndExport`, `getSyslogSettings`, `updateSyslogSettings`, `testSyslogConnection`, `getRetentionSettings`, `getCachedRetentionSettings`, `updateRetentionSettings`, `getAssetDecommissionSettings`, `updateAssetDecommissionSettings`.

**Cross-service deps:** none (reads Settings, spawns sftp/scp/nc, uses prisma Event table).

**Used by:** `src/jobs/pruneEvents.ts:20,25 — scheduled archive/export`; `src/jobs/decommissionStaleAssets.ts:13 — inactivity threshold`; `src/api/routes/events.ts — admin CRUD endpoints`; `capacityService.ts:997 — capacity transition Event creation`. ~8 call sites.

**Invariants:**
- All successful Events are written to `prisma.event.create()` by callers (routes, services, jobs); eventArchiveService does not write Events, only manages their export/retention.
- Archive export (SFTP/SCP) reads Events older than cutoff, writes JSON file, transfers via ssh/sftp spawn, then deletes from DB (via pruneEvents job).
- Retention cache (1 min TTL) avoids DB read on every Event write; callers using `getCachedRetentionSettings()` must accept stale data.
- Asset decommission threshold (0 = disabled) is in months; lastSeen older than that triggers `decommissioned` status in a separate 24h job.
- Syslog (UDP/TCP/TLS) sends test messages synchronously; real event forwarding NOT in this service (would be added as a background job).
- SFTP batch-file injection prevention: paths with quotes/newlines rejected before spawn.

**When changing this:**
- Test archiveAndExport with large Event payloads (>10k rows); verify SFTP/SCP progress.
- Verify retention cache doesn't mask rapid setting changes; 60s may be too long for some ops.
- Check asset decommission query doesn't accidentally mark live assets as stale (lastSeen >= cutoff).
- Confirm syslog test messages arrive with the right facility/severity/format.
- Validate SFTP injection prevention doesn't reject legitimate Windows paths with backslashes.

## services/fortigateService.ts

**What it owns:** Standalone FortiGate REST API client & discovery (mirrors FMG scope—DHCP subnets, reservations, device inventory, interface IPs, managed FortiSwitches/FortiAPs, VIPs).

**Public API:** testConnection, fgRequest, proxyQuery, discoverDhcpSubnets, FortiGateConfig, plus re-exported DiscoveryResult & 6 DiscoveredXxx types from FMG.

**Cross-service deps:** fortimanagerService (imports DiscoveryResult shape + types; fortimanagerService imports fgRequest, testConnection, proxyQuery for proxy-mode device iteration).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/integrations.ts:529,695,851,1107,1269 — discovery + test + manual proxy query, src/services/monitoringService.ts:35 — REST calls for uptime monitoring, src/services/reservationPushService.ts:21 — direct REST push of DHCP reservations, src/services/assetQuarantineService.ts:44 — direct REST push of quarantine targets.

**Invariants:**
- fgRequest is the low-level bearer-token auth layer; all per-device queries use it.
- discoverDhcpSubnets returns DiscoveryResult identical to FMG's shape so integrations.ts syncDhcpSubnets pipeline handles both identically.
- FortiAP LLDP/mesh extraction reuses extractApLldpAndMesh (same logic as FMG).
- Standalone FortiGate has no proxy/direct toggle (useProxy doesn't apply); all queries go directly to the device's management IP.
- proxyQuery is a read-only REST pass-through for manual API testing; does not modify CMDB.
- Per-FortiGate query fan-out is seven parallel chains (A-G); Chain G calls `/api/v2/monitor/system/ha-peer` to populate `DiscoveredDevice.haMode` + `haMembers`. 404 / empty = standalone.
- Chain G failures are isolated — a hung HA query never tanks the whole device's discovery (same try/catch pattern as Chains A-F).

**When changing this:**
- Verify DiscoveryResult shape matches fortimanagerService exactly—sync pipeline expects field parity.
- Check monitoringService and both push services still call fgRequest with correct vdom/token/method signatures.
- Confirm proxyQuery handles GET/POST/PUT/DELETE correctly for manual testing route.
- Test discovery parallelism (no clamping unlike FMG proxy mode) with high per-device concurrency.
- Ensure VDOM parameter threading is correct (default "root"; custom vdoms from config).
- Adding another per-FortiGate REST endpoint: add an 8th chain inside the Promise.all rather than appending after — keeps wall-clock at max(chain) instead of sum(chains).

---

## services/fortigateCoordPushService.ts

**What it owns:** Write-back orchestrator for FortiGate `gui-device-latitude` / `gui-device-longitude` (and FMG `Latitude` / `Longitude` metavars when applicable) after `syncDhcpSubnets` resolves a geocoded sysLocation that diverges from the device's current CMDB values.

**Public API:** `pushCoordsToFortigate(integration, deviceName, latitude, longitude): Promise<CoordPushResult>`.

**Cross-service deps:** fortimanagerService (uses native FMG helpers `setFmgDeviceMetaFields` + `setFmgDeviceCmdbGuiCoords`), fortigateService (uses `fgRequest` for the standalone CMDB PUT).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/integrations.ts:syncDhcpSubnets Phase 3 — fires once per FortiGate after the per-HA-member loop, gated on `pushGeocodedCoords` + geocode success + `coordsClose()` mismatch.

**Invariants:**
- FMG mode writes BOTH per-device metavars AND CMDB GUI coords. Standalone FortiGate writes only CMDB. Single source of truth for routing — never inline another transport choice in callers.
- All FMG writes go through the native lane (no `/sys/proxy/json` wrapper) — they don't share the proxy-lane concurrency=1 constraint.
- Best-effort: per-target failures are collected into the returned `{ok, targets[], error?}` shape but never thrown. Audit events (`integration.coords.pushed` / `integration.coords.push_failed`) live at the caller in integrations.ts, not here.
- FMG-mode CMDB writes land in FMG's CMDB but do NOT trigger an FMG install — the live FortiGate sees the change only when an operator runs Install Device Configuration in FMG. UI text on the toggle surfaces this caveat.
- Coords are formatted as `.toFixed(6)` strings before sending (FortiOS stores them as strings, not floats).

**When changing this:**
- Adding a new write target: add a new try/catch arm, push the target name onto the `targets` array on success, log + continue on failure (don't throw).
- If extending to integration types beyond fortimanager / fortigate, mirror the type-dispatch pattern from reservationPushService — never inline a new transport builder.
- Verify both modes when changing the FMG payload: re-discover with `pushGeocodedCoords` on; confirm metavars + CMDB both updated via `curl` directly against FMG's REST API.

---

## services/fortigateLocationService.ts

**What it owns:** Discovery-time REST pull of FortiGate SNMP sysLocation (`GET /api/v2/cmdb/system.snmp/sysinfo`). REST instead of net-snmp so it reuses the existing FMG-proxy / standalone transport and doesn't need a separate SNMP credential.

**Public API:** `fetchFortigateSysLocation({integration, deviceName}): Promise<string | null>`.

**Cross-service deps:** reservationPushService (imports `callFortiOs` + `buildTransportForIntegration`).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/integrations.ts:syncDhcpSubnets Phase 3 — gated on the integration's `fortigateMonitor.pullSnmpLocation` toggle. Fires ONCE per FortiGate per discovery cycle (NOT per HA member — cluster members share sysLocation by physical co-location).

**Invariants:**
- REST-only. Never bring back an SNMP path here — adding net-snmp would re-introduce a credential resolver + per-host gate that the REST approach deliberately sidesteps.
- Returns trimmed, whitespace-collapsed string OR null. Empty FortiOS response → null. Transport failures → null (logged at warn).
- Never throws. The discovery sync continues with no location update on failure.
- Works in BOTH FMG proxy and direct modes — FMG forwards the call to the FortiGate in proxy mode, so Polaris doesn't need network reachability to the FortiGate's mgmt IP.

**When changing this:**
- Adding new SNMP system-info fields (sysContact, sysDescription): same endpoint already returns them. Extend the interface and surface as additional return fields rather than adding new endpoints.
- Don't add retries here — the caller (syncDhcpSubnets) treats this as a single-shot, best-effort fetch; retry logic would burn discovery wall-clock for marginal value.

---

## services/fmgWorker.ts

**What it owns:** Per-integration FortiManager worker with two lanes — a proxy lane (strict concurrency=1 FIFO) for `/sys/proxy/json` calls and a native lane (unbounded) for every other FMG call. Module-level `Map<integrationId, FmgWorker>` lazy-created on first submit; never torn down.

**Public API:** `getFmgWorker(integrationId): FmgWorker`, `FmgWorker.submitProxy<T>(label, task, signal)`, `FmgWorker.submitNative<T>(label, task, signal)`, `FmgWorker.proxyQueueDepth`, `FmgWorker.proxyInFlightLabel`, `FmgWorker.nativeInFlightCount`, `__resetFmgWorkersForTests`.

**Cross-service deps:** metrics (publishes `polaris_fmg_worker_queue_depth{integrationId}` + `polaris_fmg_worker_inflight{integrationId}` for the proxy lane, `polaris_fmg_worker_native_inflight{integrationId}` for the native lane).

**Used by:** src/services/fortimanagerService.ts only — specifically `rpc()`, which inspects each JSON-RPC payload's first param URL and routes to `submitProxy` when it's `/sys/proxy/json` or `submitNative` otherwise. No other module should call `submitProxy` / `submitNative` directly; everything that touches FMG flows through `rpc()` and gets the right lane automatically. By transitivity covers reservationPushService.ts, assetQuarantineService.ts, monitoringService.ts, and the integrations.ts routes that test / probe / manual-query FMG.

**Invariants:**
- Proxy lane is strict FIFO with concurrency=1 — honors FMG's "drops parallel /sys/proxy/json past 1-2" constraint. Cross-feature serialization holds here: an operator clicking "Reserve IP" mid-discovery has the reservation-push proxy call wait behind in-flight discovery proxy calls.
- Native lane is unbounded; the worker just tracks inflight count for observability. Native FMG endpoints (`/pm/config/...`, `/dvmdb/...`, auth) hit FMG's own DB and have no parallel-call constraint.
- Aborts (proxy lane): pre-dispatch abort drops the queued entry and rejects with AbortError. In-flight abort is the task's fetch-signal responsibility.
- Aborts (native lane): no queue, so abort just bubbles through the task's own fetch signal.
- One worker per integration id. Different integrations get independent workers and run fully concurrently across both lanes.

**When changing this:**
- Adding a NEW FMG-bound code path: just call `rpc()` with the integrationId; the lane dispatch is automatic from the JSON-RPC payload URL. Never call `submitProxy` / `submitNative` directly from outside fortimanagerService.
- If a new FMG endpoint pattern shows up that needs lane treatment different from "is it /sys/proxy/json", update `rpcPayloadIsProxy()` in fortimanagerService — keep the predicate the only place that decides which lane.
- Test both lanes when adding behavior — the proxy lane is exercised by FIFO + abort tests; the native lane by concurrent-fire + inflight-decrement-on-throw tests.

---

## services/fortimanagerService.ts

**What it owns:** FortiManager JSON-RPC API client & full discovery orchestration (DHCP subnets, device inventory, interface IPs, VLAN membership, DHCP reservations, FortiSwitches/FortiAPs, VIPs, ARP).

**Public API:** testConnection, resolveDeviceMgmtIpViaFmg, testRandomFortiGate, proxyQuery, fmgProxyRest, proxyQueryViaFortigate, discoverDhcpSubnets, FortiManagerConfig, DiscoveryResult, DiscoveryProgressCallback (and 6 DiscoveredXxx types). Every entry point accepts an optional `integrationId?: string` (and `discoverDhcpSubnets` additionally accepts `warmCacheIps?: Map<string,string>`); when supplied, internal `rpc()` calls funnel through `getFmgWorker(integrationId)` so FMG traffic stays serial against the "one-request-at-a-time" constraint.

**Cross-service deps:** fortigateService (imports discoverDhcpSubnets for direct-mode fallback; imports fgTestConnection and proxyQuery for proxy testing); fmgWorker (every rpc call routes through `getFmgWorker` when an integrationId is in scope).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/integrations.ts:531,693,824,840,1107,1283 — discovery orchestration + test + manual proxy query + realtime push via FMG, src/services/monitoringService.ts:39 — FMG proxy REST for uptime monitoring, src/services/reservationPushService.ts:26 — push DHCP reservations to FortiGate via FMG proxy/direct, src/services/assetQuarantineService.ts:49 — push quarantine targets via FMG proxy/direct.

**Invariants:**
- Proxy mode (`useProxy: true`, default) clamps per-FortiGate parallelism to 1 because FortiManager drops parallel `/sys/proxy/json` connections. The FMG worker's proxy lane enforces that serialization; the per-device CMDB scrapes (interface config, DHCP CMDB, VIPs, geo coords, etc.) run concurrently on the worker's native lane, so per-device throughput is higher than the proxy-lane bottleneck alone would suggest.
- Direct mode (`useProxy: false`) requires valid fortigateApiUser/fortigateApiToken on the FMG integration; mgmt IPs come from either the warm cache (monitor-up firewall Asset rows) or `resolveDeviceMgmtIpViaFmg` for cache-cold/new devices. Cache-cold mgmt-IP resolves now run concurrently across the worker pool (native lane is unbounded) — fresh installs no longer pay the serial-resolve penalty before per-device discovery can start.
- All FMG-bound calls go through `rpc()`, which inspects the JSON-RPC payload's first param URL and routes to `getFmgWorker(integrationId).submitProxy` (when it's `/sys/proxy/json`) or `submitNative` (every other URL). Per-device direct-FortiGate calls do NOT touch FMG and fan out up to `discoveryParallelism` wide independently of the worker.
- Parity invariant: both FMG and standalone FortiGate return identical DiscoveryResult shape for sync pipeline compatibility.
- FortiAP LLDP/mesh fields extracted via extractApLldpAndMesh, skipping wireless-mesh peers (system_description != "FortiSwitch-*").
- Cache-miss fallback in processDevice's direct-mode branch: if a warm-cache dispatch fails, re-resolve via FMG worker and retry once at the freshly-resolved IP. Cleared via `cachedNames.delete(deviceName)` so the loop never iterates more than twice.
- HA detection is **zero extra calls**: `extractHaFromFmgDevice(raw)` reads `ha_mode` + `ha_slave[]` directly off each `/dvmdb/adom/<adom>/device` record FMG already returns. The "current primary" is identified by matching `ha_slave[].sn` against `device.sn`; `idx === 0` is the fallback. Standalone devices return `{ haMode: "standalone", haMembers: [] }` so downstream code branches uniformly.
- Direct-mode HA precedence: when FMG's `ha_slave[]` is populated, it wins over fortigateService's `ha-peer`-derived view (FMG's view is stable across failover; ha-peer reflects whichever physical box is currently active and would flip on failover).

**When changing this:**
- Verify parity with fortigateService.discoverDhcpSubnets (DiscoveryResult shape + field semantics).
- Check reservationPushService & assetQuarantineService both call fmgProxyRest correctly for proxy mode + resolveDeviceMgmtIpViaFmg for direct mode, AND that both pass `integrationId` so the call routes through the FMG worker.
- Confirm monitoringService still resolves management IPs and calls fmgProxyRest with `integrationId` for proxy-mode health checks.
- Update docs/fmg-discovery.md if transport modes, roster filters, or per-class stamping change.
- Test proxy-mode parallelism clamp + direct-mode device resolution end-to-end. Confirm warm-cache producer fills the worker pool from t=0 on a fleet with monitor-up firewalls.
- New FMG-bound code paths MUST submit through `getFmgWorker(integrationId)` — bare `rpc()` without an integrationId loses cross-feature serialization and reintroduces the parallel-connection failure mode.

---

## services/geocoderService.ts

**What it owns:** Address-string → lat/lng geocoder backed by OpenStreetMap Nominatim with a positive+negative `GeocodeCache` (90-day TTL) and a process-global 1 req/sec rate limiter.

**Public API:** `geocode(query: string): Promise<{ latitude: number | null, longitude: number | null, cached: boolean }>`.

**Cross-service deps:** None (uses prisma directly for cache reads/writes; `getAppVersion()` for the Nominatim User-Agent).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/integrations.ts:syncDhcpSubnets Phase 3 — geocodes FortiGate SNMP sysLocation when `fortigateMonitor.pullSnmpLocation` is on.

**Invariants:**
- Normalization key: trim + collapse-whitespace + lowercase. Same on read and write so capitalization / spacing variants collide on one cache row.
- Cache stores BOTH positive AND negative results. A null lat/lng row means "Nominatim returned no match" — the negative-cache signal that prevents gibberish strings from repeatedly hitting upstream.
- Transport failures (timeout / non-2xx / parse error) do NOT write a cache row. Only the upstream's actual response (success OR empty array) writes — so a transient Nominatim outage doesn't poison subsequent retries.
- Rate limiter is module-level chained Promise enforcing ≥1100 ms between outgoing requests (Nominatim's usage policy is 1 req/sec; 100 ms safety margin). Cache hits BYPASS the gate entirely.
- User-Agent identifies Polaris per Nominatim's usage policy (`Polaris-IPAM/<version>`). Never use a generic / library-default UA.
- Never throws. All failures return `{latitude: null, longitude: null, cached: false}` so callers in the discovery hot path don't need to wrap.

**When changing this:**
- Don't add per-request retries — Nominatim's policy is "be patient and don't hammer us"; one shot per cycle, fall through on failure, retry on next discovery.
- TTL is 90 days. Lengthening it reduces upstream load further; shortening risks operators editing sysLocation and waiting too long to see the new pin location. Don't go below 7 days.
- Adding a second provider (Google / Mapbox): introduce a `provider` parameter, store provider per cache row (already in schema), and run all writes through a single normalization so the cache stays consistent.
- If extending to other domains (e.g. non-FortiGate asset location lookups), keep the rate limiter shared — Nominatim doesn't care which Polaris feature triggered the request, only the rate-per-process matters.

---

## services/interfaceTopologyService.ts

**What it owns:** Infer inter-Fortinet device topology edges (FortiGate ↔ FortiSwitch ↔ FortiAP stacks) from interface naming conventions & serial patterns without new live queries.

**Public API:** inferInterfaceTopology, InterfaceInferredEdge, InterfaceInferredRemote, InterfaceInferenceResult.

**Cross-service deps:** None (reads AssetInterfaceSample rows and in-memory asset inventory; calls utility functions).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/map.ts:19 — topology graph for Device Map (sites/:id/topology endpoint); src/services/dependencyTreeService.ts — Phase 12 of FMG/FortiGate sync via `recomputeDependencyTree`.

**Invariants:**
- Reads latest AssetInterfaceSample per (assetId, ifName) from seed asset set within a 1-hour timestamp window; no live discovery queries. The window exists to filter out interfaces that have stopped reporting (asset down/decommissioned, monitoring disabled) — drawing a topology edge from a stale sample would be wrong data. Default system-info cadence is 600s, so 1 hour tolerates ~5 missed scrapes without admitting genuinely-stale interfaces. Without the bound the DISTINCT ON had to scan the entire active hypertable chunk and was observed at 13.5 min / 90M rows / 9 GB I/O on a fleet of ~600 infra assets.
- Serial-match candidates filtered to exact 1 inventory hit (ambiguous matches skipped); hostname-match same rule.
- Self-loops (asset's own serial/hostname) are rejected.
- Infers both directions when both sides' interface names encode peer identity; targetIfName null when only source side is parseable.
- Matches via parseFortinetPeerInterface utility; peer IP/MAC/model returned from remoteAssets even if outside seed set (cross-site edges).
- Returned edge ifNames are translated from aggregate name to underlying physical member when the aggregate has EXACTLY one physical child (ifType="physical" + ifParent=aggregate). Multi-member aggregates fall back to the aggregate name. The aggregate is still the inference signal (peer identity is encoded there); only the display ifName on the edge is normalized so topology labels read as physical-port-to-physical-port instead of peer-serial-encoded aggregate names.

**When changing this:**
- Verify parseFortinetPeerInterface still extracts serial + hostname patterns correctly.
- Confirm ambiguity detection (multiple inventory matches) still blocks inference on both directions.
- Test cross-site edge rendering (remoteAssets for peers outside seed set) in map.ts.
- Validate serialMatchesPeerInterface and hostnameMatchesPeerInterface utility functions.
- The 1-hour window is a perf gate, not a correctness one — if tightening further (e.g. 30 min), confirm the system-info cadence isn't longer than the window/2 for any tier-3 settings; widening it (e.g. back to 24h) re-incurs the Phase 12 scan cost.

---

## services/ipService.ts

**What it owns:** IP validation, availability checking, and subnet capacity reporting.

**Public API:** assertValidIp, assertValidCidr, assertIpInSubnet, isIpAvailable, getActiveReservationsForSubnet, subnetCapacity.

**Used by:** src/api/routes/reservations.ts (multiple callers), src/services/reservationService.ts (ipInCidr, detectIpVersion), src/services/reservationPushService.ts (isValidIpAddress).

**Invariants:**
- IPv4-only for capacity calculations (IPv6 raises 400)
- All CIDR inputs are normalized (host bits zeroed)
- IP addresses must be validated before subnet containment checks
- Active reservations indexed on subnetId + status = "active"

**When changing this:**
- Review all calls to assertValidIp/assertValidCidr in routes (ipAddress validation gates many Reservation operations)
- Check utilization calculations depend on subnetCapacity (affects Dashboard utilization card)
- Test with both IPv4 and IPv6 where applicable

---

## services/manufacturerAliasService.ts

**What it owns:** Manufacturer alias CRUD (IEEE legal name → marketing name), in-memory alias map cache synced to Prisma extension, background backfill of normalized strings in Asset and MibFile rows, and idempotent default seed.

**Public API:** `listAliases`, `createAlias`, `updateAlias`, `deleteAlias`, `refreshAliasCache`, `seedDefaultAliases`, `applyAliasesToExistingRows`, `ManufacturerAliasRow`.

**Cross-service deps:** None (consumed by routes and jobs).

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/manufacturerAliases.ts:11 — admin CRUD endpoints`, `src/jobs/normalizeManufacturers.ts:18 — startup seeding and backfill`, `src/db.ts:32 — Prisma extension normalizer hook`.

**Invariants:**
- In-memory map (`setAliasMap()` in `manufacturerNormalize.ts`) must be refreshed after every mutation.
- `seedDefaultAliases()` is idempotent; only inserts missing rows (no overwrites).
- `applyAliasesToExistingRows()` respects (manufacturer, model, moduleName) uniqueness; logs warnings when normalization would create duplicates.
- Prisma extension hooks `normalizeManufacturer()` on all Asset/MibFile create/update/upsert calls.

**When changing this:**
- Update `DEFAULT_ALIASES` constants when IEEE-registered names change or new vendor aliases are discovered.
- Verify `createAlias()` uniqueness check is case-insensitive (alias is lowercased).
- Test `applyAliasesToExistingRows()` backfill with duplicate-collapse edge cases (two rows collapsing to same canonical).
- Confirm `refreshAliasCache()` is called after every CRUD mutation (create/update do this; delete does not since no rows change).
- Inspect `src/db.ts` Prisma extension to ensure normalizer is wired to all manufacturer-write paths.

## services/mibService.ts

**What it owns:** Parsing, validation, and CRUD for uploaded SNMP MIB modules. The light validator (`parseMib`) gates uploads (1MB cap, rejects binaries, extracts moduleName + IMPORTS). The heavier peer (`parseMibStructured`) drives the Browse + MIB-aware Walk surface — extracts SYNTAX, INTEGER enum value labels, ACCESS, STATUS, DESCRIPTION, INDEX clauses, and SEQUENCE OF table structure. Per-(manufacturer, model, moduleName) uniqueness is enforced at create.

**Public API:** `parseMib`, `parseMibStructured`, `listMibs`, `getMib`, `createMib`, `deleteMib`, `getMibFacets`, `getProfileStatus`, `ParsedMib`, `ParsedMibStructured`, `MibSymbol`, `MibTable`, `MibBaseType`, `MibAccess`, `MibStatus`, `MibSymbolKind`, `MibEnumValue`, `MibSummary`, `MibFilter`, `CreateMibInput`, `ProfileStatus`, `ProfileSymbolStatus`.

**Cross-service deps:** `oidRegistry` (refreshRegistry, resolveSymbolAtVendorScope, listModelOverrides), `vendorTelemetryProfiles` (VENDOR_TELEMETRY_PROFILES), `mibParserUtils` (stripComments).

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/mibs.ts — list/get/upload/delete + Browse `/structure` + MIB-aware `/walk``, `src/services/oidRegistry.ts:17 — refreshes the symbol table on create/delete`, `src/services/monitoringService.ts — via oidRegistry for vendor profile matching`.

**Invariants:**
- SMI parser validates UTF-8 text only (rejects NUL and control chars <0x20 except tab/CR/LF).
- Module header required: `<NAME> DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN`; footer required: `END`.
- Duplicate check on (manufacturer, model, moduleName) tuple catches generics via explicit query (NULL handling).
- Successful create/delete always refreshes oidRegistry immediately.
- `parseMibStructured` is a peer of `parseMib`, NOT a superset call. A regression in the structured parser must not be reachable from the upload hot path. Per-symbol parse failures degrade fields to null rather than dropping symbols.

**When changing this:**
- Verify `createMib` duplicate-check logic handles NULL fields in your test data.
- Confirm `parseMib` rejects binary/non-text files (test with fixture files).
- Run `getProfileStatus()` against your vendor MIBs to ensure symbol resolution still works.
- Update `DEFAULT_ALIASES` in `manufacturerAliasService.ts` if adding new vendor facets.
- Check `src/api/routes/mibs.ts` (NOT `serverSettings.ts`) for upload/list/delete endpoint compliance — the MIB routes were extracted there to take precedence over `/server-settings`'s blanket `requireAdmin`.
- Re-run `tests/unit/mibParseStructured.test.ts` — covers IF-MIB-style table detection, INTEGER enum extraction, multi-line DESCRIPTION, embedded `""` quote escapes, and comment-tolerant enum bodies.

## services/monitoringService.ts

**What it owns:** Asset health monitoring via probes, telemetry collection, and state machine transitions across five monitor states (unknown → recovering → up → warning → down).

**Public API:** `probeAsset`, `resolveMonitorSettings`, `resolveMonitorSettingsWithProvenance`, `recordProbeResult`, `recordTelemetryResult`, `recordSystemInfoResult`, `recordFastFilteredResult`, `collectTelemetry`, `collectFastFiltered`, `collectSystemInfo`, `collectLldpOnlyFortinet`, `collectLldpOnlySnmp`, `snmpWalkRaw`, `probeCredentialAgainstHost`, `getMonitorSettings`, `updateMonitorSettings`, `invalidateMonitorSettingsCache`, `getAdMonitorProtocol`, `runProbeFor`, `runTelemetryFor`, `runSystemInfoFor`, `runFastFilteredFor`, `runMonitorPass`, `pruneMonitorSamples`, `pruneTelemetrySamples`, `pruneSystemInfoSamples`, `ProbeResult`, `MonitorTierSettings`, `MonitorOverrideSettings`, `ResolvedMonitorSettings`, `AssetMonitorContext`, `ProvenanceTier`, `ResolvedSettingsWithProvenance`, `TelemetrySample`, `InterfaceSample`, `StorageSample`, `TemperatureSample`, `IpsecTunnelSample`, `LldpNeighborSample`, `SystemInfoSample`, `CollectionResult`, `SnmpWalkRow`, `SnmpWalkResult`, `MonitorCadence`, `CadenceOutcome`.

**Cross-service deps:** `fortigateService.ts`, `fortimanagerService.ts`, `timescaleService.ts`, `oidRegistry.ts`, `vendorTelemetryProfiles.ts`.

**Used by:** `src/app.ts:47` — boot timescale detection; `src/api/routes/credentials.ts:17` — probe credential testing; `src/api/routes/integrations.ts:24` — AD monitor protocol selection; `src/api/routes/assets.ts:24` — effective monitor settings + probe request; `src/api/routes/monitorSettings.ts:23` — cache invalidation; `src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts:40` — core monitor loop dispatch; `src/jobs/migrateMonitorSettingsHierarchy.ts:36` — cache invalidation; `src/services/capacityService.ts:41` — monitor settings for capacity calculation.

**Invariants:**
- **Four-tier resolver:** per-asset overrides (top) → class override → integration/manual tier → hardcoded floor. Call `invalidateMonitorSettingsCache(scope)` after any tier-3 or tier-2 write to refresh `resolveMonitorSettings()` on next call. The eight cadence/timeout fields (`intervalSeconds`, `cpuMemoryIntervalSeconds`, `temperatureIntervalSeconds`, `systemInfoIntervalSeconds`, `probeTimeoutMs`, `cpuMemoryTimeoutMs`, `temperatureTimeoutMs`, `systemInfoTimeoutMs`) cascade through every tier; `failureThreshold` and the three retentions stop at tier-2 (class override). The stream split (Slice 2) means CPU/memory and temperature carry independent polling method / credential / MIB / timeout / cadence columns at every tier — the dispatcher consumes `cpuMemoryPolling` / `cpuMemoryTimeoutMs` / `cpuMemoryIntervalSeconds` / `cpuMemoryCredentialId` / `cpuMemoryMibId` as the unified telemetry signal for now; a follow-up commit splits the dispatcher loop so temperature gets its own independent SNMP session.
- **Five-state machine:** unknown → (cs≥threshold) recovering, (cf≥threshold) warning; recovering → (cs≥threshold) up, (cf≥threshold) down; up → (cf=1) warning, (cf≥threshold) down; warning → (cs≥threshold) up, (cf≥threshold) down; down → (cs=1) recovering, stay down.
- **Heavy-cadence suppression:** telemetry/systemInfo/fastFiltered run only when `monitorStatus === "up"`; all other states suppress to avoid unreliable samples.
- **Per-transport dispatch:** probes dispatch on polling method (rest_api → probeFortinet/probeFortinetController; snmp → probeSnmp; winrm → probeWinRm; ssh → probeSsh; icmp → probeIcmp). REST API probes to `/api/v2/monitor/system/status`; SNMP probes `sysUpTime` OID.
- **Per-host SNMP gate:** every SNMP path (probeSnmp + the `withSnmpSession` helper that fronts collectTelemetrySnmp / collectSystemInfoSnmp / collectLldpNeighborsSnmp / operator snmpWalkRaw) acquires a per-`host:port` FIFO lock so probe and heavy walks don't overlap on a single-threaded agent. Without it, a 10-min systemInfo IF-MIB+LLDP walk pins the agent and the cheap sysUpTime probe stretches from <50ms to 3-5 s (often past the probe timeout → reads as packet loss). Keyed on host:port not assetId so two assets sharing one SNMP target don't collide. FortiOS REST and FMG calls aren't routed through this gate — they have their own concurrency models. **probeSnmp resets `start = performance.now()` inside the gate's callback** so the reported `responseTimeMs` reflects only the device round-trip, not the FIFO wait behind a concurrent walk — otherwise probes queued behind a 20 s fastFiltered IF-MIB walk reported as ~20 s on the chart, producing a perfect zig-zag against the bare-probe ~2 ms samples.
- **vendorTelemetryProfiles + oidRegistry consumers:** collectTelemetry/collectSystemInfo/collectLldpOnlySnmp call `pickVendorProfile()` and `resolveOidSync()` for SNMP walks; boot calls `ensureRegistryLoaded()` for warm cache.
- **Credential fallback chain:** asset-level credential → integration-stored token/SNMP → inherited from FMG on FMG-discovered firewalls.
- **Sample writes are async-buffered, status writes are synchronous.** The six append-only sample tables (asset_monitor / asset_telemetry / asset_temperature / asset_interface / asset_storage / asset_ipsec_tunnel) go through `sampleWriteBuffer.enqueue*` and flush every 2 s. `Asset.update` for `monitorStatus` / counters / `last*At` and the per-asset `$transaction` for `assetAssociatedIp` and `persistLldpNeighbors` stay synchronous because they need read-modify-write or per-asset replace semantics that an append-only buffer can't provide. Future contributors adding a new cadence must NOT batch the asset.update — the state machine reads counters then writes new ones, and batching would break that.
- **One Asset findUnique per probe.** `probeAsset(assetId, out?)` populates `out.snapshot` with the asset row it already loaded (with credential + integration includes). `recordProbeResult(assetId, result, preloadedAsset?)` accepts that snapshot to skip its own findUnique. Hot-path callers (runProbeFor) pass the out-object; the operator /probe-now route doesn't bother and pays the extra read.
- **LLDP asset match index is module-cached.** `persistLldpNeighbors` reads through `getLldpAssetMatchIndex()` which caches the index for 60 s and dedupes concurrent rebuilders via an inflight Promise. Stale-cache risk is one cycle of "LLDP neighbor matched to wrong asset" — self-corrects on next scrape. Discovery code that bulk-renames assets / rotates IPs / mass-MAC-edits can call `invalidateLldpMatchCache()` before its next sync if it wants the immediate refresh; the 60 s TTL is the safety net otherwise.

**When changing this:**
- Audit state-machine transitions and verify no edge cases leave assets in phantom states (esp. recovery threshold tuning).
- Update the resolver's tier caches if any integration/manual/override schema changes.
- If adding/removing transport probes, update `pollingCompatibility.ts` matrix and route validation in `monitorSettings.ts`.
- Verify `dropChunks()` calls before sample deletion align with active retention tiers.
- Test supervisor isolation: probe tick (5s) must not block heavy tick (30s) via `runningProbe`/`runningHeavy` guards.

## services/oidRegistry.ts

**What it owns:** Per-asset scoped OID symbol resolution from MIBs (device → vendor → generic → seed), layered SCOPED symbol caching with per-symbol provenance, and lazy cache warmup at app startup.

**Public API:** `resolveOid`, `resolveOidSync`, `ensureRegistryLoaded`, `refreshRegistry`, `resolveSymbolAtVendorScope`, `listModelOverrides`, `getMibSymbolCount`, `resolveSymbolsForMib`, `resolveSymbolForMib`, `parseObjectAssignments`, `ResolveScope`, `SymbolStatus`.

**Cross-service deps:** `mibService` (via import in mibService for refreshRegistry calls), `mibParserUtils` (stripComments).

**Used by:** `src/app.ts:46 — startup warmup`, `src/services/monitoringService.ts:43 — telemetry probe resolution`, `src/services/mibService.ts:17 — profile status introspection`, `src/api/routes/mibs.ts — Browse modal OID resolution + MIB-aware walk symbol → numeric OID lookup`.

**Invariants:**
- Resolution is scoped per (manufacturer, model) tuple; both cached and layer-resolved case-insensitively.
- Cache rebuilt entirely on any `refreshRegistry()` call (no partial updates).
- Built-in seed (BUILT_IN_OIDS) always acts as final fallback; vendor OIDs override generic MIBs.
- Seed currently covers Cisco / Juniper / HP-Aruba / Dell-RADLAN / Fortinet FortiGate / FortiSwitch / FortiAP — each vendor seed includes the vendor-specific telemetry symbols (CPU / memory and, where applicable, disk / temperature) so probes work without uploading the proprietary MIB.
- `resolveOidSync()` returns null until `ensureRegistryLoaded()` has completed and the scope has been accessed.

**When changing this:**
- Add coverage to BUILT_IN_OIDS if new standard SMI roots or vendor enterprise prefixes are needed.
- Test scope layering with overlapping (manufacturer, model) MIBs to verify override order.
- Verify cache key normalization (case-insensitive) handles mixed-case manufacturer input correctly.
- Run `resolveSymbolAtVendorScope()` after updates to confirm vendor-floor symbol availability.
- Profile performance: cache rebuild is O(mibs × entries × resolution-passes); log timings on large uploads.

## services/ouiService.ts

**What it owns:** IEEE OUI database download and CSV parsing; lazy in-memory lookup map; admin-editable overrides (prefix → manufacturer+device); cache persistence via Setting table.

**Public API:** lookupOui, lookupOuiBatch, lookupOuiOverride, refreshOuiDatabase, getOuiStatus, OuiOverride, getOuiOverrides, setOuiOverride, deleteOuiOverride.

**Used by:**
- src/api/routes/assets.ts:15 — GET /assets/:id, look up MAC OUI (vendor name)
- src/api/routes/integrations.ts:21 — POST /integrations/discover, tag assets with vendor during discovery
- src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts:36 — GET/PUT /server-settings/oui, CRUD overrides + trigger refresh
- src/jobs/ouiRefresh.ts:30 — Weekly cron job, refresh database and log entries/size

**Invariants:**
- IEEE database is downloaded from standards-oui.ieee.org/oui/oui.csv; stored as JSON in Setting table; loaded on-demand into module-level in-memory map (singleton pattern, reset only on refresh).
- Prefix format: "AABBCC" (6 hex chars); input normalization handles colon/dash/mixed-case (AA:BB:CC, aa-bb-cc, etc.).
- Overrides take priority over IEEE DB; back-compat layer supports legacy bare-string overrides (migrate to {manufacturer, device?} shape on load).
- lookupOuiBatch() avoids repeated DB reads; used by discovery to tag multiple assets in one pass.
- refreshOuiDatabase() runs at startup (skip if <6 days old) and weekly; on 30s HTTP timeout, entire refresh fails (not incremental).

**When changing this:**
- Test MAC normalization (colon/dash/mixed-case input) and prefix extraction.
- Verify override priority (override lookup before IEEE DB).
- Test batch lookup (multiple MACs in one call).
- Check CSV parser for quoted fields (commas inside quotes should not split).
- Ensure refresh doesn't block startup; use timeout so network failures don't hang boot.

## services/projectionDriftService.ts

**What it owns:** Best-effort fire-and-forget shadow drift detection after successful AssetSource upserts; logs disagreements only (observability, no behavior change).

**Public API:** `detectAndLogDrift(assetId, integrationKind)`

**Cross-service deps:** None (uses `projectAssetFromSources()` utility + pino logger).

**Used by:** (Not yet called; Phase 3b shadow phase pending Phase 3b.1 actual write implementation)

**Invariants:**
- Fire-and-forget: any internal error is swallowed via `logger.warn()`; drift detection failures must never break the Asset write.
- Drift is asymmetric: projection has X ≠ Y on asset → logged; projection has X, asset null → logged; projection null → silent (no comment = no disagreement).
- Logs to pino with `event: "asset.projection.drift"` (NOT audit Event table); high volume during full sweeps, operators grep app logs.
- Compared fields: hostname, serialNumber, manufacturer, model, os, osVersion, learnedLocation, ipAddress, latitude, longitude (match `ProjectedAsset` keys).
- Logs include `assetId, integrationKind, drifts[]` with per-field projected/current/winningSource provenance.

**When changing this:**
- Sync `PROJECTED_FIELDS` list against `ProjectedAsset` interface additions (assetProjection.ts).
- If projection rules change in `projectAssetFromSources()`, review which drifts are expected (e.g. hostname tiebreak logic).
- Check pino logger setup in `src/utils/logger.ts` for structured field compatibility.
- Once Phase 3b.1 write is implemented, wire `detectAndLogDrift()` into the post-upsert callback in discovery sync paths.

---

## services/queueService.ts

**What it owns:** Monitor work queue mode dispatch (cursor vs. pg-boss) and pg-boss runtime lifecycle. Boot-time mode capture ensures the running process's queue strategy is frozen at startup despite subsequent Setting writes.

**Public API:** `detectPgboss`, `isPgbossInstalled`, `getQueueMode`, `setQueueMode`, `getBootTimeMode`, `initializeQueue`, `startPgbossWorkers`, `stopPgbossWorkers`, `isPgbossRunning`, `publishMonitorJob`, `QUEUE_NAMES`, `QueueMode`.

**Cross-service deps:** `monitoringService.ts`.

**Used by:** `src/app.ts:48` — queue initialization and pg-boss worker lifecycle; `src/jobs/monitorAssets.ts:47` — queue mode dispatch and job publishing; `src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts` — queue mode write; `src/services/capacityService.ts:43` — capacity snapshot input (queue mode + pg-boss status).

**Invariants:**
- **Boot-time mode capture:** mode read once at startup into `bootTimeMode`; `setQueueMode()` updates Setting + cache but never affects running process. New mode takes effect on next restart only.
- **Four queue names:** `polaris-monitor-probe`, `polaris-monitor-fastfiltered`, `polaris-monitor-telemetry`, `polaris-monitor-systeminfo` (jobs prefixed `polaris-monitor-*`).
- **Stalled-worker watchdog:** monitors pgboss.job for >50 created jobs with 0 active; auto-recovers up to 3 times per hour; logs every minute after cap hit.
- **Singleton job policy:** queues are created with `policy: "singleton"` + `singletonKey: ${assetId}:${cadence}` on publish so duplicate `(assetId, cadence)` sends are absorbed while a job is queued or active. `publishDueWork()` can fire every tick without piling stale work, and distinct assetIds run in parallel up to `localConcurrency`. (An earlier iteration passed `policy: "exclusive"` here, which is not a documented pg-boss policy and silently capped each queue to ~1 active job globally regardless of `localConcurrency` — turning a 16-worker pool into a serial consumer and diluting effective probe/telemetry cadence by 10×+ on large fleets. If you see queue depth sustained in the hundreds with active count stuck at 1-2, check this value first.)
- **Two pools per queue:** dedicated `boss.work()` subscriptions own a flat 24 slots per queue (env `POLARIS_MONITOR_PROBE_WORKERS` / `_FAST_WORKERS` / `_HEAVY_WORKERS`); a single floating loop (`startFloatingWorkers`, default 32 via `POLARIS_MONITOR_FLOATING_WORKERS`) polls all four queues in `FLOAT_PRIORITY` order via `boss.fetch()` and dispatches manually with `boss.complete(name, id)` / `boss.fail(name, id, ...)`. Floating capacity flows to whichever queue has backlog. Singleton-key dedup at the publish layer prevents floating ↔ dedicated collisions on the same `(assetId, cadence)`. The loop is shut down via `floatingLoopRunning = false` in both `stopPgbossWorkers` and the auto-recovery path BEFORE calling `boss.stop()` so it doesn't try to fetch against a dead boss instance.
- **Per-queue handler timeout (`EXPIRE_BY_QUEUE`):** pg-boss kills handlers that exceed `expireInSeconds` with `handler execution exceeded Ns` and marks them failed before the in-handler try/catch can stamp an error. The values are sized per cadence to the worst-case real work — probe 30s (single network call), fastFiltered 60s (one collector round-trip), telemetry 180s (SNMP CPU/mem/sensor walks), systemInfo 300s (full interface + storage + IPsec + LLDP walk). A uniform 60s cap was killing telemetry/systemInfo jobs mid-walk on slow SNMP devices, producing queue backlog that workers couldn't drain (every kill re-published the job on the next tick, looking like worker shortage when actually each slot was burning 60s per zombie). Raising the cap doesn't add parallelism — it reduces it by letting slow jobs finish on the first attempt instead of cycling through worker slots.

**When changing this:**
- Verify boot initialization runs before monitor ticks fire (happens in `app.ts` startup order).
- If tuning worker counts, check `POLARIS_MONITOR_*_WORKERS` env vars align with concurrency in `monitorAssets.ts`.
- Test pg-boss fallback to cursor when extension/role permissions fail silently.
- Ensure graceful pg-boss shutdown on SIGTERM drains in-flight jobs before process exit.

---

## services/reservationPushService.ts

**What it owns:** DHCP reserved-address push/unpush to FortiGate via FMG proxy or direct REST.

**Public API:** normalizeMac, pushReservation, updatePushedReservation, unpushReservation, releaseDhcpLease, plus the transport helpers `buildTransportForIntegration` / `findScopeIdForCidr` / `listReservedAddresses` / `callFortiOs` (+ types `Transport`, `FortiOsReservedAddress`) exported so peer services can reuse the same FMG-proxy / direct-FortiGate dispatcher for read-only single-scope work.

**Cross-service deps:** fortigateService (fgRequest), fortimanagerService (fmgProxyRest, resolveDeviceMgmtIpViaFmg).

**Used by:** src/services/reservationService.ts:15 (pushReservation on create, unpushReservation on release, releaseDhcpLease on dhcp_lease release); src/services/subnetRefreshService.ts:29 (read-only per-subnet refresh consumes the transport helpers).

**Invariants:**
- MAC address must be 48-bit (normalized to xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx)
- Transport selection: useProxy=true → FMG proxy, useProxy=false → direct FortiGate REST
- Direct mode requires fortigateApiToken + mgmtInterface on integration config
- Scope resolution by matching gateway+netmask or ip-range start-ip
- Verify-by-readback mandatory; failure throws AppError (triggers reservation rollback)
- Description format: "Polaris/<user>: <hostname>" or "Polaris: <hostname>"
- Lease release (releaseDhcpLease) uses /api/v2/monitor/system/dhcp/release-lease (best-effort, no rollback)

**When changing this:**
- Test both FMG proxy and direct modes with actual FortiOS DHCP server configs
- Verify MAC normalization handles all separators (colons, dashes, dots, none)
- Check scope resolution fallbacks (gateway+netmask, then ip-range)
- Test verify-by-readback on slow devices (echoed id missing, need IP+MAC lookup)

---

## services/reservationService.ts

**What it owns:** Reservation creation, updates, release, expiry, and DHCP push orchestration.

**Public API:** listReservations, getReservation, createReservation, updateReservation, releaseReservation, nextAvailableReservation, expireStaleReservations.

**Cross-service deps:** reservationPushService (pushReservation, updatePushedReservation, unpushReservation, releaseDhcpLease, normalizeMac).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/reservations.ts:12 (all CRUD + next-available), src/jobs/expireReservations.ts:11 (expireStaleReservations every 15 min).

**Invariants:**
- MAC address required when push eligible (subnet discovered by FMG/FortiGate with pushReservations=true)
- Full-subnet reservation (ipAddress=null) → subnet.status = "reserved"; per-IP → remains available
- No duplicate active reservations (unique constraint on subnetId, ipAddress, status="active")
- Subnet must not be deprecated (409 if status="deprecated")
- Push failure rolls back the Polaris reservation (fail-on-failure semantics)
- updateReservation accepts an optional `macAddress`; on push-eligible subnets a MAC change pushes a PUT to the FortiGate via reservationPushService.updatePushedReservation BEFORE the Polaris write — device-side failure throws and Polaris stays untouched. Clearing the MAC on a push-eligible subnet is rejected with 400 (DHCP reservations are MAC→IP).
- updateReservation auto-stamps `owner = caller.username` when `input.owner === undefined`. Pairs with the discovery sync's MAC-aware owner-preservation rule in `integrations.ts` `syncDhcpSubnets` Phase 6 — discovery only overwrites owner with `asset.assignedTo` when the discovered MAC differs from `reservation.macAddress`, so a Polaris-stamped owner survives across discovery cycles for stable reservations.
- Released reservations clear pushedTo* fields and drop historical released rows (unique constraint relief)
- Discovered dhcp_lease release attempts bestEffort via releaseDhcpLease (failure does not block Polaris release)

**When changing this:**
- Test createReservation's push eligibility detection and MAC validation order
- Verify releaseReservation's transaction scope (unpush, lease release, subnet status reset)
- Check expireStaleReservations is called every 15 min via jobs/expireReservations.ts
- Audit the atomic create-and-push path for rollback edge cases (orphaned device entries)

---

## services/reservationStaleService.ts

**What it owns:** Stale DHCP-reservation detection, alerting, and alert management (snooze, ignore).

**Public API:** getStaleSettings, updateStaleSettings, listStaleReservations, snoozeReservation, setStaleIgnored, flagStaleReservations.

**Used by:** src/api/routes/reservations.ts:13 (list/snooze/ignore endpoints), src/jobs/flagStaleReservations.ts:19 (flagStaleReservations every 6 hours).

**Invariants:**
- Stale threshold (staleAfterDays) defaults to 60 days, 0 = disabled
- Cold-start grace: effective baseline = max(createdAt, detectionStartedAt) to avoid flooding on first run
- A row is stale if (lastSeenLeased < threshold OR never seen leased before) AND (threshold > 0)
- Snooze extends alert by staleAfterDays from now (not from threshold); clears staleNotifiedAt
- Ignored rows stay suppressed regardless of threshold; detectionStartedAt persists across runs
- flagStaleReservations emits one reservation.stale Event per fresh transition (staleNotifiedAt null → timestamp)
- Discovery clears staleNotifiedAt on re-sighting (re-arms alert for future silence)

**When changing this:**
- Verify staleAfterDays threshold propagates to all callers (threshold=0 should disable all alerts)
- Test cold-start grace window (rows pre-dating detectionStartedAt get full threshold window)
- Check flagStaleReservations only fires on active dhcp_reservation rows (not discovered dhcp_lease)
- Audit snooze idempotency: repeated snooze clicks should extend from "now" not from prior snooze

---

## services/dnsResolvedReservationService.ts

**What it owns:** Auto-creation, update, and release of `sourceType="dns_resolved"` Reservation rows that mirror Assets whose primary `ipAddress` isn't covered by an authoritative reservation. Plays no part in DHCP push, conflict raising, or asset writes themselves — strictly a downstream observer of the Asset table.

**Public API:** `reconcileDnsResolvedForAsset(assetId)`, `reconcileDnsResolvedForAllAssets()`, `releaseDnsResolvedForAsset(assetId)`, `releaseDnsResolvedAt(subnetId, ipAddress)`, `ReconcileResult` interface.

**Used by:** `src/db.ts` Prisma extension (per-asset reconcile on create/update/upsert; release on delete); `src/jobs/reconcileDnsResolvedReservations.ts` (periodic sweep); `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` `syncDhcpSubnets` + `registerFortinetHost` (inline `releaseDnsResolvedAt` before each authoritative create); `src/services/reservationService.ts:createReservation` (same inline release for manual creates).

**Invariants:**
- `sourceType="dns_resolved"` + `createdBy="system:dns-resolved"` is the system-actor signature — both are required to identify a row as system-owned.
- Identity match for "is this asset's existing row?" = `createdBy=SYSTEM_ACTOR AND sourceType=dns_resolved AND status=active AND (macAddress=asset.macAddress OR hostname=asset.hostname)`. Reservation has no `assetId` FK so this is the proxy.
- Eligible asset statuses: `active | maintenance | storage | quarantined`. `decommissioned | disabled` always release-without-creating.
- IPv4 only (gated by `detectIpVersion(ip) === "v4"`).
- Defers silently to ANY non-released non-dns_resolved active reservation at the same `(subnetId, ipAddress)`. Never raises a Conflict.
- Never pushes to FortiGate — writes go through `prisma.reservation.create` directly, not `reservationService.createReservation`.
- All public functions are best-effort: they log at warn and never throw out of the public surface so a transient DB error can't break the asset write that called them.
- Events emitted: `reservation.dns_resolved.created`, `reservation.dns_resolved.updated`, `reservation.dns_resolved.released` (info level).

**When changing this:**
- Adding a new authoritative `sourceType`? Add a `releaseDnsResolvedAt(subnetId, ip)` call in `integrations.ts` next to the new create, and (if it can be created from the manual UI) in `reservationService.createReservation`. The activeResMap exclusion already covers the discovery read path.
- Adding a new column to the eligibility check? Update `assetEligible()` and ensure the periodic job's `findMany` scope still surfaces rows that need release-without-create. The job intentionally scans even ineligible-by-status assets so they can release stale rows.
- Switching to a real `Reservation.assetId` FK? Replace `findOwnedSystemRows`'s identity-match SQL with a direct join, and the per-asset reconcile becomes trivially correct (no more "hostname or MAC" heuristic).
- Verify the unique-on-active constraint: create an authoritative reservation at an IP that has a dns_resolved row; the release MUST run before the create (the order matters — Postgres can't have two active rows at the same `(subnetId, ipAddress)`).
- Performance check at 2000 monitored assets: the periodic sweep should complete in seconds. If it slows, raise BATCH from 25; the inner work is one `findContainingSubnet` + one upsert per asset, both index-friendly.

## services/sampleWriteBuffer.ts

**What it owns:** Periodic batch-flush buffer for the six append-only monitor sample tables (asset_monitor_samples / asset_telemetry_samples / asset_temperature_samples / asset_interface_samples / asset_storage_samples / asset_ipsec_tunnel_samples). Collapses per-work-item `prisma.<table>.create*` calls into one `createMany` per 2 s flush window so the monitor hot loop stops eating DB pool capacity per probe.

**Public API:** `enqueueMonitorSample`, `enqueueTelemetrySample`, `enqueueTemperatureSamples`, `enqueueInterfaceSamples`, `enqueueStorageSamples`, `enqueueIpsecTunnelSamples`, `flushAllSampleBuffers`, `startSampleWriteBuffer`, `shutdownFlushSampleBuffers`, `FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS`, all six row-type interfaces.

**Cross-service deps:** `prisma` (db.js), `retryOnDeadlock` (utils/dbRetry.js), `startSampleWriteTimer` + `setSampleBufferDepth` (metrics.js), `logger` (utils/logger.js).

**Writers (the only callers of `enqueue*`):**
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:recordProbeResult` — `enqueueMonitorSample` for the probe outcome row.
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:recordTelemetryResult` — `enqueueTelemetrySample` (CPU/memory) and `enqueueTemperatureSamples` (per-sensor).
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:recordSystemInfoResult` — `enqueueInterfaceSamples`, `enqueueStorageSamples`, `enqueueIpsecTunnelSamples`.
- `src/services/monitoringService.ts:recordFastFilteredResult` — same three as systemInfo, smaller subset (pinned interfaces only).

**Readers:** none directly. The sample tables are read by `assets.ts` route handlers (chart endpoints), `capacityService.ts` (sample-table breakdown), and Cytoscape topology builders — none of those see the buffer, only the persisted rows after a flush.

**Boot + shutdown:**
- `src/app.ts:startSampleWriteBuffer()` called once after queue init.
- `src/app.ts` SIGTERM/SIGINT hook awaits `shutdownFlushSampleBuffers()` before `process.exit(0)` so a graceful restart drains the buffer.

**Invariants:**
- **Append-only.** No conflicts on createMany — every row is a fresh time-series sample with a synthetic UUID `id`. Don't try to add upsert/dedupe logic; if you need replace semantics, do it synchronously in the record function before enqueueing (cf. `persistLldpNeighbors`, which is NOT buffered for this reason).
- **Snapshot-on-flush.** `flushTable` splices the current array up front so concurrent enqueues during the awaited `createMany` land in a fresh array. On retry-exhausted failure the snapshot is re-prepended for the next tick.
- **Per-table flush guard.** `flushing[key]` prevents re-entry on the same table — a 2 s tick that fires while a slow flush is still mid-write becomes a no-op for that table, no concurrent writer per table.
- **Trade-off documented:** up to 2 s of sample rows lost on hard crash. Acceptable because samples are an append-only time series and the next cadence tick re-supplies; UI state (Asset row, status pill) is still synchronous.

**When changing this:**
- New sample table → add a `BufferKey`, an `enqueueXxx` helper, a `TABLE_LABEL` entry, and a `switch` arm in `writeBatch`. Touch the test file too — same shape.
- Flush interval change → consider both UI latency (samples take this long to appear on charts) and crash-window data loss. The current 2 s was the explicit operator choice.
- Don't add a `prisma.$transaction` here. `createMany` is one network round-trip already; wrapping it in a transaction just adds round-trips without giving us anything (each table is independent, no cross-table invariant).

## services/searchService.ts

**What it owns:** Global typeahead search across all domain entities, with input classification (IP/CIDR/MAC/text) and parallel entity-specific queries capped at 8 results per group.

**Public API:** `searchAll`, `normalizeMac`.

**Cross-service deps:** none (uses cidr.js utils and prisma directly).

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/search.ts:14 — GET /api/v1/search endpoint`. Total 1 call site.

**Invariants:**
- MAC normalization handles any whitespace/colon/dash separator; result is uppercase colon form.
- CIDR vs plain IP vs MAC classification is hierarchical: CIDR requires `/` with `/\d{1,2}$` pattern; IP uses `isValidIpAddress()` fallback; MAC is compact 12-hex-digit match with any separator.
- PER_GROUP_LIMIT (8) caps all six hit groups (blocks/subnets/reservations/assets/ips/sites); order is stable (name/hostname/cidr asc).
- Pinned firewalls (assetType=firewall + lat/lng set) are queried as their own group via `searchPinnedFirewalls`; `searchAssets` excludes them at the SQL layer via a `NOT { AND: [...] }` filter so each group gets an independent 8-row budget. Both pathways funnel through `runAssetSearch(like, mac, baseFilter)` which owns the OR clauses + four cross-search pathways + dedup merge — keep them in lock-step when adding new asset-search fields.
- `runAssetSearch` runs five parallel pathways merged into one 8-row dedup pipeline: `byAsset` (direct Asset OR including `assignedTo` and `department`), `sourceHits` (`AssetSource.externalId` with `entra:` / `ad:` / `fgt:` / `intune:` / `fortiswitch:` / `fortiap:` prefix-strip), `macSideHits` (`AssetMacAddress.mac`), `ipSideHits` (`AssetAssociatedIp.ip`), and `jsonHitIds` (raw-SQL UNION over `assets.associatedUsers::text` + `asset_sources.observed::text` ILIKE — backed by the GIN trigram indexes from migration `20260507200000_search_json_trgm_indexes`). `byAsset` wins ties; the side / source / JSON pathways fill remaining budget in that order. Apply `baseFilter` to every pathway (including the JSON-id reload) so the firewall vs. non-firewall partition holds.
- Asset origin resolution (for topology modal focus) prioritizes most-recent DHCP sighting, falls back to `learnedLocation` for Entra/AD-discovered hosts.
- AssetSource externalId search strips `entra:`, `ad:`, `fgt:`, `intune:`, `fortiswitch:`, `fortiap:` prefixes so operators can paste either form.

**When changing this:**
- Test IP classification edge cases (IPv6, /32 subnets, partial CIDR).
- Verify site/firewall filtering doesn't drop valid results.
- Confirm AssetSource dedup logic preserves the right hit when both asset and source rows match.
- Check PER_GROUP_LIMIT doesn't regress; pagination in dropdown expects exactly 8 per group.
- Validate MAC normalization handles all common formats (colon, dash, no separator).

## services/serverSettingsService.ts

**What it owns:** Server-wide configuration: NTP (servers, timezone), HTTPS (certs, ports, redirect), and certificate management (upload, list, delete, self-signed generation).

**Public API:** `getNtpSettings`, `updateNtpSettings`, `getHttpsSettings`, `updateHttpsSettings`, `listCertificates`, `addCertificate`, `deleteCertificate`, `generateSelfSignedCert`, `resolveHttpsCertificates`.

**Cross-service deps:** none.

**Used by:** `src/app.ts:385 — boot-time HTTPS port selection`; `src/httpsManager.ts:41,12 — TLS setup and request redirection`; `src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts — full CRUD endpoints`. ~6 call sites across routes and init.

**Invariants:**
- NTP, HTTPS, certificate lists persist in Settings table under `key: "ntp"`, `"https"`, `"certificates"` respectively.
- HTTPS enabled requires both certId and keyId; if either is missing, `resolveHttpsCertificates()` returns null (no TLS active).
- Self-signed cert CN must match `/^[A-Za-z0-9.*_-]+$/` to prevent openssl injection via `/` field separator.
- Certificate store is a single JSON array in the "certificates" Setting; each cert carries id, category (ca/server), type (cert/key), PEM, and metadata.
- Backup/restore flows NOT in this service (they live in updateService).

**When changing this:**
- Test cert upload validation (PEM parsing, magic-byte checks if added).
- Verify HTTPS port changes take effect on next boot, not runtime.
- Check self-signed cert generation doesn't fail on Windows (openssl path).
- Confirm cert list dedup handles UUID collisions.
- Test cascading delete: if a server cert is deleted, routes using it should gracefully skip TLS.

## services/subnetRefreshService.ts

**What it owns:** Per-subnet "refresh from device" reconciler — the action behind the **Refresh** button in the IP panel slide-in. Queries the originating FortiGate for ONE DHCP scope (CMDB reservations + live leases), reconciles against Polaris's `dhcp_reservation` + `dhcp_lease` rows on the same subnet, and bumps `Subnet.lastDiscoveredAt`. Manual / VIP / interface-IP rows are left alone.

**Public API:** refreshSubnet(subnetId, actor) → { lastDiscoveredAt, created, updated, released, skipped }.

**Cross-service deps:** reservationPushService (buildTransportForIntegration, findScopeIdForCidr, listReservedAddresses, callFortiOs, normalizeMac), events.logEvent.

**Used by:** src/api/routes/subnets.ts (POST /subnets/:id/refresh route handler — user-or-above).

**Invariants:**
- Only works on subnets whose `discoveredBy` integration is type fortimanager or fortigate, AND `fortigateDevice` is set; 400 otherwise.
- CMDB reservations win on overlap with a live lease for the same IP (matching syncDhcpSubnets' source-of-truth ordering).
- Manual / VIP / interface-IP rows on the same subnet are skipped — the next full integration discovery is where Polaris raises hostname/owner conflicts on those rows via upsertConflict.
- Releases dhcp_*-sourced active rows whose IPs are no longer on the device (operator removed them on the FortiGate). Does NOT touch reservations on other subnets.
- Bumps `Subnet.lastDiscoveredAt` only on success (so the IP panel's "Discovered N minutes ago" updates).

**When changing this:**
- Keep the scope narrow: don't reach into asset sightings / decommissions / map regions — those are owned by `syncDhcpSubnets` and reconcile on the next full integration cycle.
- If the read shape from FortiOS `/api/v2/monitor/system/dhcp` changes, update both `fetchLiveLeasesForScope` here AND the corresponding shape in fortimanagerService.ts / fortigateService.ts so the partial refresh and full discovery stay in sync.
- Description-to-hostname extraction (`extractHostnameFromDescription`) is the inverse of `buildDescription` in reservationPushService — keep them paired.

---

## services/subnetService.ts

**What it owns:** Subnet creation, allocation, bulk templates, and lifecycle (manual vs discovered).

**Public API:** listSubnets, getSubnet, createSubnet, allocateNextSubnet, bulkAllocate, previewBulkAllocate, updateSubnet, getSubnetIps, deleteSubnet.

**Cross-service deps:** ipService (indirectly via cidrContains/cidrOverlaps from utils/cidr.ts).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/subnets.ts:7 (all operations), src/services/reservationService.ts (subnet lookups, status checks), src/services/utilizationService.ts (subnet status grouping).

**Invariants:**
- Subnet must be contained within parent block CIDR
- No overlapping sibling subnets in the same block (checked before create)
- IPv4-only for auto-allocation (allocateNextSubnet, bulkAllocate)
- Subnet status = "deprecated" rejects new reservations
- Full-subnet reservation (ipAddress=null) sets subnet status → "reserved"
- Prefix length must be [8, 32] for IPv4
- **First-claim parity (discovery side, lives in `src/api/routes/integrations.ts` syncDhcpSubnets Phase 1):** when a discovery cycle's CIDR matches a manual subnet (`existing.discoveredBy == null`), the row gets brought into parity with a freshly-discovered subnet — `name` rewritten to `DHCP: <scope> (<fortigate>)`, `status` reset to `available`, `tags` union-merged with `["dhcp-discovered", <integrationType>]`, `purpose` stamped only when blank. Subsequent passes see `discoveredBy` set and skip the claim branch (operator can rename/retag after claim and edits survive). One `subnet.claimed` Event per first-claim.

**When changing this:**
- Test allocateNextSubnet's findNextAvailableSubnet logic (concurrent allocations must not race)
- Verify bulkAllocate's anchor-aligned packing (all-or-nothing transaction)
- Check updateSubnet does not allow status changes that violate reservation constraints
- Review overlapping-sibling check performance for large blocks

## services/timescaleService.ts

**What it owns:** TimescaleDB extension detection and hypertable migration for six sample tables; `dropChunks` pre-filter for retention pruning. Boot-time detection caches hypertable status; subsequent `isHypertable()` checks return cached value without round-tripping.

**Public API:** `detectTimescale`, `isTimescaleAvailable`, `isHypertable`, `getDetectionState`, `dropChunks`, `migrateToHypertables`, `SAMPLE_TABLES`, `SampleTableName`, `DetectionState`.

**Cross-service deps:** none.

**Used by:** `src/app.ts:47` — boot detection and hypertable migration; `src/services/monitoringService.ts:56` — `dropChunks` calls in pruning; `src/services/capacityService.ts:42` — hypertable status for capacity snapshot.

**Invariants:**
- **Boot-time detection cache:** `detectTimescale()` caches result; cache updates only on successful probe. Re-detection runs after `migrateToHypertables()` completes so `isHypertable()` reflects post-conversion state.
- **`dropChunks` no-op on plain Postgres:** checks `isHypertable(tableName)` early and returns immediately if false; safe to call unconditionally as a pre-filter before per-class `deleteMany`.
- **`migrateToHypertables()` idempotent:** creates hypertables only if not already present; compression policy removed and re-added every boot so `TIMESCALE_COMPRESS_AFTER_DAYS` changes take effect on next startup.
- **Chunk-granular drops:** `drop_chunks` can only drop a chunk when ALL rows are older than cutoff; fast O(1) filter for old chunks before residue cleanup via `deleteMany`.

**When changing this:**
- Verify `detectTimescale()` is called before any sample write so hypertable status is fresh.
- If modifying `SAMPLE_TABLES`, keep in sync across detection, pruning, and migration logic.
- Test plain-Postgres fallback path: verify `dropChunks` no-op and `deleteMany` handles all pruning when extension unavailable.
- Check compression policy drift if operators change `TIMESCALE_COMPRESS_AFTER_DAYS` mid-boot cycle (only takes effect next restart).

## services/totpService.ts

**What it owns:** RFC 6238 TOTP secret generation, enrollment QR codes, time-windowed code verification (±30s), and argon2id-hashed backup code generation and consumption.

**Public API:** generateSecret, buildEnrollment, verifyCode, generateBackupCodes, consumeBackupCode.

**Cross-service deps:** none.

**Used by:**
- src/api/routes/auth.ts:602 — POST /totp/enroll, QR code + secret generation
- src/api/routes/auth.ts:603 — POST /totp/enroll, render QR SVG
- src/api/routes/auth.ts:209 — POST /login/totp, verify TOTP code during login
- src/api/routes/auth.ts:625 — POST /totp/confirm, validate code at enrollment finish
- src/api/routes/auth.ts:203 — POST /login/totp, consume backup code on fallback
- src/api/routes/auth.ts:629 — POST /totp/confirm, generate backup codes on enable
- src/api/routes/auth.ts:668 — DELETE /totp, consume backup code on disable
- src/api/routes/auth.ts:671 — DELETE /totp, verify code before disabling

**Invariants:**
- TOTP secret must be base32-encoded; verify operations accept ±1 step (30s drift tolerance) to absorb client/server clock skew.
- Backup codes are 10 hex pairs (XXXX-XXXX format), argon2id-hashed on generation, never returned in plaintext after enrollment.
- Backup code consumption is stateless (caller must persist the returned array); no rate limiting on individual code attempts — the login lockout gate (5 failures, 15 min) protects the flow.
- Two-phase login flow: password success → pendingToken issued; TOTP/backup-code step consumes pendingToken and upgrades to full session.

**When changing this:**
- Test both TOTP verification (standard code + ±1 step boundary) and backup code round-trips (generation, hashing, consumption, array mutation).
- Audit all call sites in auth.ts for pendingToken lifecycle (issue at line 118, consume at 195/226/233).
- If adjusting RFC 6238 params (SHA1, 6 digits, 30s step): users must re-enroll; plan migration messaging.
- Verify no secrets leak into logs (codes are transient; hashes are stored on User rows — check password.ts utility).

## services/updateService.ts

**What it owns:** In-app software update check, availability detection (Docker vs git checkout), update application pipeline (backup→pull→npm ci→prisma generate→tsc→migrate→restart), and progress tracking.

**Public API:** `initUpdateStatus`, `getUpdateStatus`, `isUpdateMechanismAvailable`, `clearUpdateStatus`, `checkForUpdates`, `applyUpdate`, `getRecentCommits`.

**Cross-service deps:** none (spawns git/npm/prisma, reads/writes .update-status.json, creates DB backup).

**Used by:** `src/api/routes/serverSettings.ts:1135,1143,1151,1159 — Application Updates card endpoints`; `src/jobs/updateCheck.ts:19,31 — hourly check job`. ~6 call sites.

**Invariants:**
- Update mechanism disabled in Docker (`/.dockerenv` present, `.git/` absent) or when no `.git/` checkout exists; `getUpdateStatus()` returns `state: "disabled"` with a human-readable reason.
- Status persists in `.update-status.json` at APP_DIR root; survives restarts.
- applyUpdate() runs background; only one apply in flight at a time (`_applying` flag).
- Backup is optional (skippable via Setting "update.skip_backup"); pre-update backups registered in "backup_history" Setting.
- Encryption: backup password → AES-256-GCM ciphertext wrapped in `[POLARIS\0][salt][iv][authTag][ct]` envelope.
- **Seven-step pipeline (order is load-bearing):** (1) backup, (2) git pull, (3) `npm ci --production=false`, (4) **explicit `npx prisma generate`**, (5) **clean `dist/` then `npx tsc`**, (6) `npx prisma migrate deploy`, (7) restart (NSSM on Windows, systemd exit(1) on Linux). Steps 4 + 5's `rm -rf dist` are defenses against the failure mode in `cross-cutting/schema-migrations-and-prisma-client-lifecycle` — never collapse them back into "trust npm ci postinstall."
- Generate-then-build-then-migrate order matters: client must be generated against the NEW schema BEFORE tsc compiles consumers, and migrations apply LAST so the client and DB are in sync at restart. Reversing any of these breaks the next start of the process.

**When changing this:**
- Test update path on both git-backed and Docker installs; verify "disabled" message is clear.
- Check backup encryption round-trip: verify restored backup is valid SQL.
- Confirm npm ci timeout (5 min) doesn't kill slow installs; adjust if needed.
- Test git pull fallback chain (origin/HEAD → origin/main → origin/master).
- Verify restart doesn't kill in-flight requests; 1.5s delay before exit(1) should be enough.
- **Do not reorder steps 3–6** without re-reading `cross-cutting/schema-migrations-and-prisma-client-lifecycle`. A reorder that puts migrate before generate-then-tsc reintroduces the failure mode where dropped columns crash the running client.
- The `rm -rf dist` between steps 4 and 5 is non-negotiable when Prisma client file layout could have changed between versions. Without it, stale `dist/generated/prisma/*.js` files can shadow the regenerated client and the running process selects columns the schema no longer has.

---

## services/utilizationService.ts

**What it owns:** Aggregates subnet usage statistics (blocks, subnets, reservations) for dashboards.

**Public API:** getGlobalUtilization, getBlockUtilization.

**Used by:** src/api/routes/utilization.ts:6 (GET / for dashboard, GET /blocks/:id for per-block drill-down).

**Invariants:**
- Global utilization counts all blocks, subnets, and active reservations in one query set
- IPv6 block addresses capped at Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER to avoid precision loss
- Deprecated subnets excluded from allocatedAddresses calculation
- Subnet status grouping: available, reserved, deprecated

**When changing this:**
- Test large fleet performance (blocks query with full subnet tree may be slow with 100k+ subnets)
- Verify usagePercent calculation (allocatedAddresses / blockAddresses) matches business intent
- Check that deprecated subnets are correctly filtered from block capacity

---

## services/vendorTelemetryProfiles.ts

**What it owns:** Built-in vendor telemetry profiles (Cisco, Juniper, Mikrotik, Fortinet FortiSwitch, Fortinet FortiAP, Fortinet FortiGate, HP-Aruba, Dell) matching assets by manufacturer + OS + model regex and exposing symbolic OID queries for CPU / memory / disk / temperature via oidRegistry resolution.

**Public API:** `VENDOR_TELEMETRY_PROFILES`, `pickVendorProfile`, `VendorTelemetryProfile`, `CpuQuery`, `MemoryQuery`, `DiskQuery`, `TemperatureQuery`.

**Cross-service deps:** None (vendorTelemetryProfiles is leaf; consumed by monitoringService + mibService).

**Used by:** `src/services/monitoringService.ts:45 — probe strategy selection for telemetry`, `src/services/mibService.ts:18 — profile status reporting in MIB database UI`.

**Invariants:**
- `match` regex is tested against `"${manufacturer ?? ''} ${os ?? ''} ${model ?? ''}".trim()` (all three fields optional).
- Entries ordered in priority; first match wins (no fallback after). Both FortiSwitch and FortiAP must precede the generic Fortinet entry because all three match `manufacturer="Fortinet"`; the model-specific regexes (`/fortiswitch/i`, `/fortiap/i`) sit before the broad `/fortinet|fortigate|fortios/i` so FortiSwitches/FortiAPs don't fall into the FortiGate OID tree.
- CPU/memory/temperature symbols resolve from one of three layers (in priority order): an uploaded MIB at the asset's scope, an entry in `oidRegistry`'s `BUILT_IN_OIDS` seed (currently covers Cisco / Juniper / HP-Aruba / Dell-RADLAN / Fortinet FortiGate + FortiSwitch + FortiAP — these vendors show "READY" out of the box), or — when neither resolves — the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB fallback inside the probe.
- `TemperatureQuery` only supports `mode: "scalar"` — table-walk vendors hit ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB directly inside `collectTemperaturesSnmp`. Scalar temperature is a third fallback used after ENTITY-SENSOR + Fortinet sensor-name heuristic both return empty; consumed by FortiAP (`fapTemperature`).
- Profile selection is read-only; no runtime mutations.

**When changing this:**
- Verify new `match` regex pattern against real asset manufacturer/OS values (case-insensitive).
- Confirm CPU/memory/temperature symbol names match the MIB files referenced in CLAUDE.md SNMP stack section.
- Test `pickVendorProfile()` with mixed-case inputs and edge cases (null manufacturer with os set).
- Add model-specific profile entries (e.g. FortiSwitch, FortiAP) BEFORE the generic vendor entry — order is the precedence mechanism.
- Update CLAUDE.md narrative if renaming or reordering built-in profiles.
- If adding a new temperature query, ensure the matching OID is seeded into `oidRegistry.BUILT_IN_OIDS` or upload coverage is required from the operator.

## services/windowsServerService.ts

**What it owns:** Windows Server DHCP discovery via WinRM PowerShell remoting (DHCP scopes, subnets, include/exclude filtering).

**Public API:** testConnection, discoverDhcpScopes, WindowsServerConfig, DiscoveredDhcpScope.

**Cross-service deps:** None (WinRM client; no service-to-service calls).

**Used by:** src/api/routes/integrations.ts:12,523,697,1109,1372 — discovery trigger, subnet sync, test connection.

**Invariants:**
- WinRM simple auth (HTTP/HTTPS, default port 5985/5986); no Kerberos.
- PowerShell Get-DhcpServerv4Scope query returns ScopeId (MAC + subnet); mapped to DiscoveredDhcpScope shape (cidr/name/fortigateDevice/dhcpServerId).
- `fortigateDevice` field repurposed to hold DHCP server hostname for compatibility with FMG/FortiGate discovery result shape.
- `dhcpInclude`/`dhcpExclude` scope filtering applied server-side before returning.
- Results fed to same syncDhcpSubnets pipeline as FMG/FortiGate (produces Subnet rows, no device inventory).
- No per-device iteration; single WinRM call returns all scopes on that server.

**When changing this:**
- Verify WinRM URL construction (scheme + port based on useSsl flag).
- Check PowerShell query still works on target Windows versions (Server 2016+).
- Confirm dhcpInclude/dhcpExclude filtering still matches scope IDs/names correctly.
- Test DiscoveredDhcpScope mapping (cidr/name/fortigateDevice/dhcpServerId) feeds syncDhcpSubnets correctly.
- Validate error messages for auth failures, service not running, connection timeouts.
